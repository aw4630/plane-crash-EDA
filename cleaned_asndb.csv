Friday 24 December 1999,,Airbus A300B2-101,Indian Airlines,,1,"Kandahar Airport (KDH) - 
	   Afghanistan",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT),Delhi-Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL/VIDP),"On December 24, 1999, Indian Airlines flight 814 was hijacked while en route to Delhi (DEL) from Kathmandu (KTM). About 30 minutes after takeoff a passenger armed with a pistol stood up and announced that the plane was being hijacked. Four other men wearing red masks then stood up and took positions throughout the aircraft. The hijackers demanded to be flown to Lahore, Pakistan. Authorities, however, refused to allow the plane to land. With the plane low on fuel, the crew was forced to fly to Amritsar-Raja Sansi Airport (ATQ), India. The hijackers demanded that the aircraft be refueled and threatened to harm passengers if this was not done. One passenger was killed about this time, apparently for failing to follow the hijackers instructions. Indian authorities refused to provide the fuel that had been demanded. The plane departed and was flown to Lahore Airport (LHE) in Pakistan, but authorities closed the airport to keep the plane from landing. The pilot told the control tower, however, that the plane would crash if not given permission to land and he made an emergency landing. The hijackers demanded food, water, and fuel, all of which were provided. The aircraft departed Lahore and was flown to Kabul Airport (KBL), Afghanistan, but was unable to land because there were no night landing facilities. The plane then flew on to Muscat, Oman, but authorities refused permission to land. The plane was then taken to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where permission to land at Dubai Airport was also refused. The pilot, however, was directed to al-Minhar Air Base, located in a remote area of Dubai, and landed there on December 25. Twenty-seven passengers were subsequently released in exchange for food and fuel. The aircraft then was flown to Kandahar Airport (KDH), Afghanistan, arriving on December 26, and stayed there for the remainder of the hijacking. In Kandahar the hijackers issued their demands. They demanded that India release Maulana Masood Azhar, a Pakistani leader of the Kashmiri separatist group Harakut-ul-Mujahidin, who was imprisoned in India. The hijackers also demanded the release of 35 other jailed guerrillas, USD 200 million, and the release of the body of a slain Kashmiri separatist. On December 26, a United Nations official arrived to mediate between the hijackers and Indian authorities following a request by the ruling Taliban forces. On December 27 the hijackers announced a deadline and threatened to kill passengers if their demands were not met. Negotiations between the hijackers and Indian diplomats continued through December 29. The hijackers eventually dropped their demands for the ransom and for the release of the prisoners. In return, India agreed to exchange three prisoners for the safe return of the aircraft and passengers. On the afternoon of December 31, the passengers and crew were released and flown to Delhi. Meanwhile, the Taliban had given the hijackers ten hours to leave Afghanistan. The five hijackers departed with a Taliban hostage to ensure their safe passage and were reported to have left Afghanistan."

The pilot tried to land in N'djamena, Chad, for refueling but was denied permission and diverted to Niamey. The hijackers demanded that Nigeria's government resign and enough fuel to fly to Frankfurt.  On October 28, with 20 hostages still being held, Niger army commandos stormed the aircraft. The four hijackers were captured but one of the hostages, the Assistant Purser, was killed in the operation."

	   India",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Mumbai (Bombay) Airport (BOM/VABB),Bangalore-Hindustan Airport (BLR/VOBG),"Indian Airlines Flight 605 took off from Mumbai, India, at 11:58 for a domestic flight to Bangalore. At 12:25 Bangalore approach was contacted and prevailing weather was passed on to the crew (wind variable 5 knots, visibility 10 km, clouds 2 octa 2000 feet, temperature 27 degrees C, QNH 1018). At 12:44 the aircraft was cleared to descend to FL110. Reaching FL110, vectors were given for a visual runway 09 approach. On final approach, the aircraft descended well below the normal approach profile and kept descending until it struck the boundaries of the Karnataka Golf Club (2300 feet short of the runway and 200 feet right of the extended centerline. The aircraft rolled for 80 feet and lifted off again for about 230 feet and came down again on the 17th green of the golf course. The landing gear wheels dug into the ground and the aircraft impacted a 12 feet high embankment, causing the gears and engines to be sheared off. The aircraft continued over the embankment and came to rest in a grassy, marshy and rocky area.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Failure of the pilots to realize the gravity of the situation and respond immediately towards proper action of moving the throttles, even after the radio altitude call-outs of ""Four hundred"", ""Three hundred"" and ""Two hundred"" feet, in spite of knowing that the plane was in idle/open descent mode. However, identification of the cause for the engagement of idle/open descent mode in short final approach during the crucial period of the flight is not possible."""

The plane was en route from Davao International Airport to Manilas Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Approximately one hour into the flight, a passenger got out of his seat and went into one of the aircrafts restrooms. He emerged armed with a .22 caliber handgun and what was later determined to be a fake hand grenade. While on his way to the cockpit, the passenger encountered a flight attendant, pulled out the handgun, and said that he was hijacking the plane. He subsequently fired a single shot toward the cockpit door, although it is believed this was done accidentally. The hijacker then ordered the flight attendant to ask the pilot to open the door. Once inside the cockpit, the man threatened to blow up the aircraft if his demands were not met. The hijacker insisted that the plane return to Davao but was told that there was not enough fuel. The man then collected money from the passengers and crew and demanded that the rear door be opened so that he could jump out using a homemade parachute. After the cabin was depressurized, a flight attendant opened the left rear door and the hijacker jumped out. The crew continued the flight on to Manila, where the plane landed safely. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew members. The hijacker was killed in his jump from an altitude of 6,000 feet because the parachute apparently malfunctioned. His body was discovered embedded in the ground about 15 kilometers east of Manila; the parachute was found about a kilometer from the body."

The airplane struck houses in a residential area, killing all 23 on board and 45 persons on the ground. The An-124 was leased from the Russian Air Force by Cargotrans to transport two Sukhoi Su-27 fighter planes to Vietnam. The planned destination was Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam with an en route stop at Vladivostok Airport (VVO), Russia. Three seconds after lifting off runway 14, at a height of about 5 m the number 3 engine surged. Climbing away with a high angle of attack engines no. 2 and 1 also surged. The airplane reached a maximum height of 66 m before it descended, striking several buildings. It crashed into a residential area, 1600 m beyond the runway end."

	   Russia",En route,Test,Voronezh-Pridacha Airport (UUOD),Voronezh-Pridacha Airport (UUOD),"An Antonov 148-100E jet, registered 61708, was destroyed in an accident near Garbuzovo, Belgorod Region, Russia, killing all six crew members. The airplane, operating on its 32nd flight, was used to train pilots of the Myanmar Air Force. The AN-148 was due to be delivered to Myanmar later that year.  Around 10:40 the aircraft broke up in flight. Parts of the aircraft, including part of the horizontal stabilizer with elevator, were found 2-3 km from the main crash site.  The cause of the accident was the inadvertently permitted the aircraft to accelerate 110 km/h above the design limit speed during an emergency descent. This led to low-frequency vibrations on the aircraft in all axes, an increase of alternating accelerations exceeding the margin of safety. The result was the break  up of the aircraft in the air, followed by its collision with the earth. The main factors contributing to the accident were:  1) untimely and inadequate actions of the crew to control the emergency decent;  2) lack of proper coordination among the members of the crew;  3) deviations from recommendations in the flight manual in executing the emergency descent ;  4) misleading indications on basic instruments when outside characteristic operating conditions"

The aircraft operated on a presidential logistics support flight and departed Goma at 13:32 UTC (15:32 local time). The estimated time of arrival at Kinshasa was 16:43 UTC (17:43 local time). Last contact with the flight was at 59 minutes after takeoff from Goma. The next day the wreckage was located in a forest near Punia.  The aircraft used to be owned by the Armenian airline South Airlines, registered EK-72903. However, EK-72903, is no longer on the Armenian aircraft register and South Airlines does not seem to have an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in Armenia."

The aircraft broke up after impacting the ground some 900 m short of the runway.  Diyarbakir's runway 34 was not equipped with ILS.  CONCLUSION 1. The Flight Crew insisted on landing despite reaching the MDA at an altitude of 2800 ft and no approach lights or runway was visible. 2. Bad weather conditions contributed to the cause of the accident."
Monday 28 November 2016,21:58,Avro RJ85,LaMia,21640,71,"18 km S of Rionegro/Medellín-José María Córdova Airport (MDE) - 
	   Colombia",En route,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Santa Cruz-Viru Viru International Airport (VVI/SLVR),Rionegro/Medellín-José María Córdova Airport (MDE/SKRG),"LaMia flight 2933, an Avro RJ85, was destroyed after impacting a wooded hillside south of Rionegro/Medellín Airport, Colombia. The aircraft carried the Brazilian Chapecoense football team for a match to Medellin.  Six of the 77 occupants have survived the accident. One flight attendant and four passengers survived with serious injuries and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The initial plans were for LaMia to fly the Brazilian Chapecoense football team from São Paulo, Brazil to Medellin for the first leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals against Atlético Nacional. A refueling stop was planned at Cobija in northern Bolivia. LaMia requested a permit to fly from the Brazilian aviation authorities, ANAC, but this was denied as there were no provisions in the current aviation agreements between Brazil and Bolivia to allow such a commercial flight. The Chapecoense team was then flown to Santa Cruz in Bolivia on a regular commercial flight. This routing caused delays to the schedule and Cobija could no longer be used to refuel because of night time closure of the airport, according to the LaMia's general director. The distance of the flight planned from Santa Cruz to Medellín was 2983 km. The flight plan of LMI2933 showed an estimated flying time of 4 hours and 22 minutes and a fuel endurance of the same time. The flight crew calculated the takeoff weight to be 41,610 kgs, which was just below the maximum takeoff weight of 41,800 kgs. Investigators believe the luggage weight was underestimated and that the actual takeoff weight was 42,148 kgs. At 22:08 UTC the engines of the RJ85 were started and permission was received to taxi to runway 34 for departure. Flight LMI2933 took off from runway 34 at Santa Cruz-Viru Viru Airport at 22:18 UTC. The flight initially climbed to FL280 and later, at 23:54 UTC it climbed to FL300. En route the crew repeatedly spoke about the fuel calculations and the possibility of landing at Leticia or Bogotá to refuel, but it was decided to continue to Rionegro/Medellín. At 01:15 UTC the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording. At 02:36 hours, as the aircraft was descending through FL250, the Master Caution sounded in the fight deck, notifying the flight crew that they had 20 minutes worth of fuel left.  At 02:42 the Medellin Approach controller cleared the flight to continue their descent to FL210 and to head for the GEMLI RNAV point which is located about 30 km short of the runway 01 threshold at Rionegro/Medellín Airport. At the same time, a VivaColombia Airbus A320, flight FC8170 from Bogotá to San Andrés, was diverting to Rionegro/Medellín due to indications of a fuel leak. Three other aircraft were in a holding pattern at FL190, FL180 and FL170. At 02:45 UTC the flight reported entering the holding at GEMLI at FL210.  Four minutes later the flight requested priority for landing because of ""problems with the fuel"". The controller then stated that she would get back with vectors to the localizer and that it would take seven minutes before they could commence their approach. The controller then cleared a preceding flight, LAN3020, to start the approach. At 02:52 UTC the controller reported to LMI2933 that there was another aircraft holding below them and asked if they could hold a little while longer. The flight then responded that they had a fuel emergency and requested a final approach course and immediate descent clearance. The controller cleared the flight to turn right before it could initiate descent. She subsequently cancelled the approach clearance of LAN3020. At 02:53 selected full flaps and undercarriage down and used speed brakes in their descent. Then engine no.3 automatically shut down due to fuel exhaustion, followed by engine no.4. The flight crew did not notify the controller of this, but requested permission to immediately join the localizer. The controller assumed they were still at FL210, but the flight crew stated they were already in descent. This forced the controller to issue instructions to the other aircraft in the holding pattern to manoeuvre them away from LMI2933. She warned the flight of another aircraft ahead at FL180. LMI2933 responded that the other traffic was on their TCAS above them and that they were on final approach course. At 02:55 UTC engines no. 2 and no. 1 also shut down. At that time the aircraft was at 15,934 feet, 15.5 NM south of the runway 01 threshold. At 02:57 the crew radioed in Spanish that they had suffered a ""total electric total eh fault with no fuel"".  The controller reported that the flight was 0,1 mile from the Rionegro VOR and stated that she could not have altitude information of the flight. LMI2933 then reported being at 9000 feet. According to the instrument approach procedure published in the SKRG AIP, the minimum altitude upon passing the Rionegro VOR is 10000 feet. During the last radio contact with the flight, the crew requested vectors for the runway. The controller stated that the flight was 8.2 miles from the runway. The aircraft impacted the top of a hillside at an elevation of about 2600 m. Part of the wreckage came to rest down the wooded hillside right next to the RNG VOR beacon, 18 km short of runway 01.  Probable causes: Inappropriate planning and flight execution because the amount of fuel required to fly from the airport of destination to an alternate airport nor a quantity of reserve fuel nor the contingency fuel nor the minimum fuel of landing were taken into account, these fuel quantities are required by aeronautical regulations for carrying out this type of international flight like the one made by CP 2339 aircraft. Sequential shutdown of the four (4) engines while the aircraft was in descent performing a holding pattern at GEMLI as a result of the exhaustion of fuel on board. An inadequate decision-making process by the aircraft operating company management as a result of a lack of operational safety assurance. Loss of situational awareness and mistaken decision- making process by the crew who insisted on continuing a flight with an extremely limited amount of fuel. The crew was aware of the low level of remaining fuel; however, the crew members did not take the corrective actions required to land at an aerodrome and refuel, fact that would allow them to continue the flight safely.  Contributing Factors: Premature configuretion of the aircraft for landing during descent in holding pattern at GEMLI since considering the absence of thrust, this configuretion affected the plane's glide distance to Rionegro airport runway. Latent deficiencies in the planning and execution of non-regular transportation flights by the aircraft operator related to insufficient supply of the required amount of fuel. Specific deficiencies in the planning of the flight involved in the accident by the aircraft operator. Lack of oversight and operational control of the flight by the Operator, it did not supervise the planning of the flight nor its execution nor it made a follow-up of the flight that would have allowed to support the crew in making decisions. Absence of timely calls for ""priority"", or declaring an ""emergency"" or others by the aircraft crew members during the flight, and especially when fuel depletion was imminent in the descent phase and when performing a holding pattern which would have alerted air traffic services to provide the necessary support. Organizational and operational noncompliance by the aircraft operator in the implementation of fuel management procedures, as it did not comply in practice with the approval of the Bolivian DGAC in the process of the company certification. Delay in the approach of CP 2933 to Rionegro runway caused by its late priority request, and late emergency declaration for fuel added to heavy traffic at RNG VOR when on holding pattern."

	   France",En route,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG),"New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","The Air France Concorde, registered F-BTSC, was to depart Paris-Charles de Gaulle for a flight (4590) to New York-JFK. Departure was delayed by about one hour because the crew had requested a replacement of the thrust reverser pneumatic motor of the no. 2 engine. Also, the rear bogie truck of the left hand main undercarriage was replaced. When all 100 passengers had boarded, the plane taxied to runway 26R (4217 m long). Takeoff weight was calculated to be 186,9 tons, including 95 tons of fuel, which was one tone over the maximum takeoff weight. At 14:42:17 the crew were cleared for takeoff. At 14:42:31, the captain commenced takeoff. At 14:42:54.6, the co-pilot called one hundred knots, then V1 nine seconds later. A few seconds after that, tyre No 2 (right front) on the left main landing gear was destroyed after having run over a strip of metal lost by a Continental Airlines DC-10-30, registered N13067 which departed Paris as flight 055 to Newark five minutes before. The destruction of the tyre in all probability resulted in large pieces of rubber being thrown against the underside of the left wing and the rupture of a part of tank 5. A severe fire broke out under the left wing and around the same time engines 1 and 2 suffered a loss of thrust, severe for engine 2, slight for engine 1. By 14:43:13, as the captain commenced the rotation, the controller informed the crew the presence of flames behind the aircraft. The co-pilot acknowledged this transmission and the flight engineer announced the failure of engine no. 2. Nine seconds later the engine fire alarm sounded and the flight engineer announced ""shut down engine 2"" then the captain called for the ""engine fire"" procedure. A few seconds later, the engine 2 fire handle was pulled and the fire alarm stopped. The co-pilot drew the captain's attention to the airspeed, which was 200 kt. At 14:43:30, the captain called for landing gear retraction. The controller confirmed the presence of large flames behind the aircraft. Twelve seconds later the engine fire alarm sounded again for around 12 seconds. It sounded for the third time at about 14:43:58 and continued until the end of the flight. At 14:43:56, the co-pilot commented that the landing gear had not retracted and made several callouts in relation to the airspeed. Three seconds later, the GPWS alarm sounded several times. The co-pilot informed ATC that they were trying for Le Bourget aerodrome. Then the number 1 engine lost power as well. The aircraft entered a left turn until control was lost, crashing into hotel 'Hotellisimo' and bursting into flames.  PROBABLE CAUSE:  - High-speed passage of a tyre over a part lost by an aircraft that had taken off five minutes earlier and the destruction of the tyre. - The ripping out of a large piece of tank in a complex process of transmission of the energy produced by the impact of a piece of tyre at another point on the tank, this transmission associating deformation of the tank skin and the movement of the fuel, with perhaps the contributory effect of other more minor shocks and /or a hydrodynamic pressure surge. - Ignition of the leaking fuel by an electric arc in the landing gear bay or through contact with the hot parts of the engine with forward propagation of the flame causing a very large fire under the aircraft's wing and severe loss of thrust on engine 2 then engine 1.  In addition, the impossibility of retracting the landing gear probably contributed to the retention and stabilisation of the flame throughout the flight."

All 21 passengers and nine crew members were killed. PanAm Flight PA-292 operated on a scheduled service from Fort de France, Martinique (FDF) to New York with en route stops at Antigua (ANU), St. Croix, Virgin Islands (STX), and San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU). An IFR flight plan had been filed for the 30-minute leg to Antigua. Cruising altitude would be FL165. The Boeing 707, named ""Clipper Constitution"", took off from Fort de France's runway 27 at 11:04 UTC. Cruising altitude was reached at 11:09. The crew established radio contact with the Antigua controller at 11:15. The controller cleared the flight to the Coolidge NDB beacon at 2500 feet and told the crew to report at the beacon outbound leaving 2500 feet or field in sight. At approximately 11:25 the flight reported through FL40 with the field not yet in sight. At the same time the airplane was observed flying along the coast of the island of Montserrat in rain and below the clouds with landing gear down and flaps partially extended. Shortly afterwards the airplane struck a mountain at an elevation of 2760 feet asl and 242 feet below the summit.  Weather was poor with thunderstorms, towering cumulus, heavy rains.  CAUSE: ""The accident was the result of the aircraft descending below a safe height when its position had not been accurately established. """

The VOR at Le Raizet Airport was unserviceable when the flight approached Guadeloupe at night. Weather conditions were poor; a violent thunderstorm existed in the area and visibility was 10 km and a ceiling of 1000 feet within the squall. The crew reported over the NDB at 5000 feet and carried out a turn back towards the east to begin its final approach. Incorrect ADF indications, as a result of the thunderstorm, caused the plane to stray 15 km off the procedural let-down track. The Boeing 707 then crashed into a forest on a hill at an altitude of about 1400 feet.  PROBABLE CAUSE: 1) Breakdown of the VOR; 2) insufficient meteorological information given to the crew; 3) the atmospheric effects on the ADF indicator."

	   United Kingdom",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF),London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK),"Ariana Afghan Airlines Flight 701 departed Kabul on a flight to London-Gatwick. Intermediate stops were made at Kandahar, Beirut, Istanbul and Frankfurt. Prior to leaving Frankfurt the crew obtained the weather information of the London area. The RVR at Gatwick was 100 metres in freezing fog and no improvement was expected before 06:00 UTC the following morning. The visibility at Stansted was 2 km. The aircraft left Frankfurt at 00:36 UTC. After contacting London Airways at 01:13 the crew learned that runway 27 was in use at Gatwick and that the RVR was still 100 metres. The aircraft called Gatwick Approach at 01:27, reporting at FL50. The crew confirmed that they wanted to make an approach and were then cleared to 2,000 feet. The flight was vectored to capture the ILS. At 01:29 hrs the captain told ATC that in the event of a go-around he would proceed to the Mayfield NDB and then to London-Heathrow. Two minutes later, about 8 miles from touchdown the captain informed ATC that the aircraft was established on the ILS localiser. After the undercarriage was lowered the captain asked the flight engineer to warn him if the ""stabilizer out of trim"" warning light illuminated as it had done before while on approach to Frankfurt. After intercepting the glideslope the descent from 2,000 feet was started. At that point the ""stabilizer out of trim"" warning light illuminated. The engineer warned the captain who then saw that the autopilot was trimming the aircraft nose-down. Thinking this was wrong he disconnected the autopilot and re-trimmed the aircraft slightly nose-up. The aircraft crossed the ILS outer marker on the glide slope at 01:33 and the captain called for 30° flap, which the co-pilot set. As the flaps extended the rate of descent increased and the aircraft began to go below the glide-slope. The pilots remained unaware of the deviation from the glide-slope for some time. After the copilot called at 400 feet, the captain tried to trim the aircraft nose-up. There seemed to be no response. Both pilots then pulled back on the control column and at the same time the commander applied full power. The aircraft continued to descend and seconds later, as the nose began to rise in response to the application of elevator and power, it brushed through tree tops, knocked a chimney pot off a house, and then collided with tree trunks. This impact removed part of the starboard wing and the aircraft began to roll to the right. The aircraft broke clear of the trees and the starboard main wheels touched the ground in a field. The aircraft became airborne again, still rolling to the right, in a nose high attitude. Then the aft end of the fuselage collided with a house, which it demolished, and the aircraft disintegrated.  CAUSE: ""The accident was the result of the commander inadvertently allowing the aircraft to descend below the glide slope during the final stage of an approach to land until it was too low for recovery to be effected."""

Sunday 10 March 2019,08:44,Boeing 737 MAX 8,Ethiopian Airlines,1330,157,"50 km ESE of Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD) - 
	   Ethiopia",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD/HAAB),Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK),"Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa-Bole Airport, Ethiopia. There were no survivors among the 157 occupants.  Takeoff roll began from runway 07R at 08:38 hours local time, with a flap setting of 5 degrees and a stabilizer setting of 5.6 units.  At 08:38:44, ten seconds after rotation, the left and right recorded Angle of Attack (AOA) values deviated. The left AOA decreased to 11.1° then increased to 35.7° while value of right AOA indicated 14.94°.  This resulted in the onset of the stick shaker followed by a master caution light. At the same time the captains primary flight display (PFD) showed a drop in indicated airspeed (IAS) from 170Kt to 156Kt. The captain initially responded by reducing the pitch as a reaction to the stick shaker. This did not stop the stick shaker and the captain to stopped applying further nose down column input at a pitch angle of 7-8° above horizon Approaching 400 ft, the captain attempted to engage the autopilot (AP) but it was not successful. A second attempt failed as well. Passing 1000 ft radio altitude, at the third attempt, the autopilot was successfully engaged.  The captain asked the first officer to advise ATC of the inability to follow the planned departure due to a flight control problem and to request runway heading and climb 14,000ft. The left stall management yaw damper computer which was affected by inputs from a failed left AOA sensor calculated the left hand minimum operational airspeed erroneously above 340kt (VMO). This resulted in an overspeed warning. At the same time, the auto throttle operation was affected by the erroneous left AOA sensor value and remained in the Arm mode and failed to transition to N1 mode, which would have reduced the take-off thrust to climb thrust automatically.  The auto throttle did not give a warning or a failure flag for the flight crew when its operation was affected by the failed AOA sensor value. The first activation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) system occurred within a second where the auto throttle was supposed to reduce from take-off thrust to climb trust. And in less than another second the GPWS aural alert ""DONT SINK"" sounded twice. The activation of MCAS followed by GPWS aural alert with already ongoing stick shaker coupled with no failure flag or warning from the auto throttle in an extremely high workload environment must have caused the auto throttle remaining in the ARM mode with take-off thrust set to remain unnoticed by the crew.  At 08:39:45, captain requested flaps up and the first officer moved the flap handle to position 0. The autopilot then disengaged and the flaps reached the up position. At 08:40:00, because of the erroneous left AOA value, the MCAS activated the first automatic nose down trim for 9 seconds. At the end of the first MCAS activation the stabilizer position was 2.1 units with the captain pulling to pitch up the airplane, with a force of around 90 lbs (41 kg). At different times when the pilot applied electrical trim for short duration or longer duration the trim stopped at about 2.3 for unknown reasons. At 08:40:20 the second MCAS activation, lasting 7 seconds, was interrupted by the captains electric trim up inputs. The captain applied a nine second electric trim-up input which fully counteracted the second MCAS input and stopped the GPWS warning but it did not bring the aircraft to a neutral trim condition. When MCAS activated for the third time an automatic nose-down trim was commanded there was no corresponding motion of the stabilizer, which is consistent with the stabilizer trim cutout switches being in the cutout position. The captain repeatedly requested the first officer to pull up with him on the control column with pitch values oscillating between 7° nose up and -2° nose down. Pitch increased when both pilots applied forces, pitch decreased when a single pilot applied force (force oscillated between 80 lbs and 110 lbs (36-50 kg)). The vertical speed variations followed the variations of the pitch angle, with vertical speed was oscillating between -2,500 ft/min and 4,400 ft/min. The captain requested the first officer to try the manual trim wheel, and after seconds of intense efforts, the first officer told the captain that it was not working. This was due to the amount of force required to turn the trim wheel. At this moment the stabilizer trim was at 2.3 units with the IAS at 340 Kts. At 08:42:10 the captain asked and the first-officer to request radar control a vector to return. ATC instructed ET302 to turn right heading 260 degrees. During the radio communications with the ATC, the first officers action on the control column was released which increased forces on the captains control column. The captain then requested the first officer to check the Master Caution. Then, they both announced ""left alpha vane"". At this time the airplane was almost reaching the minimum safe altitude. After about 10 seconds the captain then told the first officer that they should pitch up together. The captain then told the first officer ""pitch is not enough"" and ""put them up"". A sound similar to stab trim cut-out switches being returned to normal was recorded on the CVR, thus the stab trim cut out switches were most likely turned back on at that moment. After a failed attempt to trim using the manual trim wheel as per the runaway stabilizer non-normal checklist and significant and unbearable amount of force on the control column, the flight crew were trying to find other means to relieve the force. The airplane was at 13800 ft; IAS was 367kt, pitch just below 1°, stabilizer at 2.3 units of trim, bank angle 21° right. The crew was busy pulling on the controls with high muscular force trying to maintain airplane flight path control and reach 14000 ft, a target on which they remained focused. Trying to maintain flight path control was a very demanding task and represented here a high workload, physically and mentally, to the detriment of every other task.  An overspeed warning added another disruption and disturbance on board. The cockpit noise environment was unsettling and further impacted the flight crews concentration. Immediately after the stab trim cut-out switches were put back in normal position, the crew attempted another unsuccessful autopilot engagement as the plane was approaching 14000 ft. At the same time, the captain applied two brief electric trim up inputs of 1 second each while pulling on the control with an average force of 100 Lbs (45 kg). The force on the controls remained between 75 and 100 Lbs.  At 08:43:20, five seconds after the trim-up inputs, the fourth MCAS triggered. The plane started to descend. During the 9-second MCAS activation, the stabilizer decreased from 2.3 units to 1 unit of trim. The captain repeatedly shouted to the first officer to pitch up. The forces were physically unmanageable by both flight crews. The aircraft began pitching nose down.  The airplane hit the ground eighteen seconds after the end of the 4th MCAS.  The investigation noted that intermittent flight control system abnormalities began well before the accident flight. Maintenance actions of relevance started occurring in December 2018 when the airplane was one month old and included several pilot write ups involving temporary fluctuations of vertical speed and altitude. There were also three reports of the airplane rolling during autopilot operation. Altitude and vertical speed indications on the PFD showed erratic and exaggerated indications.  From the maintenance log book report the airplane also suffered intermittent electrical/electronic anomalies in addition to the flight control system malfunctions. For example, three days before the crash the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Fault Light illuminated, and the APU had a protective shutdown. The onboard maintenance function computer message also indicated the Start Converter Unit (SCU) showed the APUs start system was inoperative. The SCU is located in the electrical and electronics (E/E) compartment. The captains personal computer power outlet also had no power. The possibility of intermittent electrical/electronic system defects were an underlying issue. The AOA sensor malfunction on the accident flight most likely occurred as the result of a power quality problem that resulted in the loss of power to the left AOA Sensor Heater. Evidence indicates the loss of power was likely due to a production related intermittent electrical/electronic failure involving the airplanes Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) and the AOA Sensor part.  Probable cause of the accident Repetitive and uncommanded airplane-nose-down inputs from the MCAS due to erroneous AOA input, and its unrecoverable activation system which made the airplane dive with the rate of -33,000 ft/min close to the ground was the most probable cause of the accident.  Contributing Factors 1. The MCAS design relied on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from the sensor; 2. During the design process, Boeing failed to consider the potential for uncommanded activation of MCAS, but assumed that pilots would recognize and address it through normal use of the control column, manual electric trim, and the existing Runaway Stabilizer NNC. The OMB and Emergency AD issued after the Lion Air accident included additional guidance but did not have the intended effect of preventing another MCAS-related accident; 3. While Boeing considered the possibility of uncommanded MCAS activation as part of its FHA, it did not evaluate all the potential alerts and indications that could accompany a failure leading to an uncommanded MCAS; 4. The MCAS contribution to cumulative AOA effects was not assessed; 5. The combined effect of alerts and indications that impacted pilots recognition and procedure prioritization were not evaluated by the Manufacturer; 6. Absence of AOA DISAGREE warning flag on the flight display panels (PFD); 7. The B737 MAX Crew difference CBT training prepared by Boeing and delivered to Pilots did not cover the MCAS system; 8. Failure by the manufacturer to design simulator training for pilots with regards to safety critical systems like MCAS with catastrophic consquences during undesired activation. 9. The manufacturer failed to provide procedures regarding MCAS operation to the crew during training or in the FCOM; 10. Failure by the manufacturer to address the safety critical questions raised by the airline which would have cleared out crew confusion and task prioritization."

Departure time was 12:50 CST. Chicago ARTCC cleared the crew to descend to 4000 feet and the flight was given vectors for a Midway Airport runway 31L localizer course. At 14:19 the flight was transferred to Chicago Approach Control which later requested UA553 to slow down to 180 knots and later down to 160 knots. After issuing a descent clearance down to 2000 feet at 14:23 the controller requested the flight to slow down to approach speed because of separation between UA553 and a preceding Aero Commander. At 14:24 the Aero Commander passed the Outer Marker and was cleared to land on runway 31L. Two minutes later UA553 passed the Outer Marker inbound. Then, at 14:27:04 the air traffic controller decided to issue a missed approach clearance: ""United 553 execute a missed approach make a left turn to a heading of 180 climb to 2000"". At the same time, having just reached 1000 feet, the stick shaker suddenly activated. Full power was applied and the gear was retracted in an attempt to execute a missed approach. The Boeing continued to descend however, attaining a high nose up attitude (of at least 30deg, according to some survivors). The aircraft then clipped a tree and impacted trees, houses, utility pole cables and garages before coming to rest. Post crash fire destroyed part of the fuselage.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to exercise positive flight management during the execution of a non-precision approach, which culminated in a critical deterioration of airspeed into the stall regime where level flight could no longer be maintained."""

Some 13 minutes later, while climbing through FL283, moderate to severe vibration was felt, accompanied by a smell of fire in the cockpit. The outer panel of one of the no. 1 engine fan blades detached, causing compressor stalls and airframe shuddering. Believing the No. 2 engine had been damaged the crew throttled it back. The shuddering stopped and the No 2 engine was shut down. The crew then decided to divert to East Midlands Airport. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 27. At 900 feet, 2.4nm from the runway threshold, the no. 1 engine power suddenly suffered a decrease in power. As the speed fell below 125 knots, the stick shaker activated and the aircraft struck trees at a speed of 115 knots. The aircraft continued and impacted the western carriageway of the M1 motorway 10 m lower and came to rest against a wooded embankment, 900 m short of the runway.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The operating crew shut down the No 2 engine after a fan blade had fractured in the No 1 engine. This engine subsequently suffered a major thrust loss due to secondary fan damage after power had been increased during the final approach to land. The following factors contributed to the incorrect response of the flight crew: 1. The combination of heavy engine vibration, noise, shuddering and an associated smell of fire were outside their training and experience; 2. They reacted to the initial engine problem prematurely and in a way that was contrary to their training; 3. They did not assimilate the indications on the engine instrument display before they throttled back the No. 2 engine; 4.

Weather was reported clear, but worsened fast to below minimums, with strong winds and heavy rain. After two missed approaches at Mokpo, the pilot tried a third approach for runway 06.  The aircraft struck a ridge of the Mount Ungeo (1050 feet high) at 800 feet altitude. Mokpo Airport was only equipped with VOR/DME.   Accident Cause (Conclusion)  a. It is determined that the following improper actions by the crew (captain and co-pilot) caused the accident: * The captain continued the approach flight in conditions below the standard visibility.   - The visibility standard was 2,800 meters, but at the time of the approach, it was below the criteria for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd approaches.     - 1st approach visibility: 2,400 meters (15:14)     - 2nd approach visibility: 2,600 meters (27:22)     - 3rd approach: Only wind speed communication was reported (39:47) and visibility was already below the standard, so it was not communicated.  * The captain did not maintain the approach altitude according to the VOR/DME procedure.   - At the final approach fix (4 nautical miles), the altitude should be 1,600 feet but it was not maintained for the 2nd approach.   - At the total approach fix for the 3rd approach, the altitude should be maintained at 1,600 feet at 4.6 nautical miles, but it descended to 730 feet.  * Both the captain and co-pilot lacked sufficient coordination for the landing at Mokpo Airport.   - The captain had only one official landing experience at Mokpo Airport.   - The captain had two unsatisfactory results in the company's proficiency checks and four unsatisfactory results in training landings, with a total of 15 points of criticism in the evaluation records, indicating insufficient experience in instrument flight.   - The instruction to confirm with the co-pilot was not properly communicated, making it difficult for the co-pilot to report the altitude accurately.  b. The visibility at the 3rd approach fix was below the criteria (2,000 meters) and was not communicated because it was deemed not necessary to report additional information due to the weather conditions.  c. The captain continued the approach while the visibility conditions were below the criteria. * During the 2nd approach at Mokpo Airport, all criteria were below standard and the visibility for the 3rd approach was 2,000 meters or less, already below the reporting standard, indicating additional communication was not required due to the weather conditions."

Two occupants died, nine were seriously injured and the other occupants sustained minor injuries. The airplane broke in three. Flight 8250 had departed Bogotá-Eldorado Airport (BOG) at 00:07 at night on a domestic service to San Andres Island.  The flight climbed to the en route altitude of FL360. At 01:25 Panama Control cleared the flight to descend to FL220, which was later restricted to FL240. Meanwhile the crew obtained weather information. Wind was calm with a visibility of over 10 km, but poor weather was being expected. After contacting San Andres Control the flight was cleared further down to 3000 feet and the crew were told to expect a VOR approach to runway 06. The controller also reported that a storm was passing through, without precipitation. At 01:40 the undercarriage was deployed and flaps were selected in increments to 15°. Two minutes later flaps were selected to 25° and the San Andres Tower cleared the flight to land on runway 6, reporting 10 knot winds and a rapidly deteriorating visibility in heavy rainfall. At 01:44 flaps were selected to 30° and seconds later the controller reported that the visibility had dropped to 4000 m. When the crew had the runway in sight, the captain switched off the autopilot. After descending through 500 feet the captain repeated the procedures in case they would have to go around in case of windshear. Final approach was continued until the copilot shouted to go around. Half a second later the airplane impacted terrain 49 metres short of the runway threshold. The airplane broke up, skidding to a halt just past the runway threshold.  Probable Cause: Execution of the flight below the angle of approach, due to a misjudgment of the crew, believing to be much higher, leading the aircraft to fly a typical trajectory of a 'black hole' illusion, which was experienced during the night-time approach to a runway with low contrast surrounded in bright focused lights, aggravated by bad weather of heavy rain."

The flight from Abidjan to Douala was reportedly conducted without incident.  The flight arrived about 22:00 hours local time, May 4. The scheduled departure time of 23:00 was delayed due to weather which consisted of thunderstorms with heavy rain showers. When the weather improved, flight 507 taxied to runway 12. The aircraft took off and climbed into the dark night. There were no external visual references, yet no instrument scanning was done by the crew. At 1000 feet climbing, the pilot flying released the flight controls for 55 seconds without having engaged the autopilot. The bank angle of the airplane increased continuously by itself very slowly up to 34 degrees right and the captain appeared unaware of the airplanes changing attitude. Just before the ""Bank Angle"" warning sounds, the captain grabbed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane, and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the bank angle to 50 degrees right. At about 50 degrees bank angle, the autopilot was engaged and the inclination tended to stabilize; then movements of the flight controls by the pilot resumed and the bank angle increased towards 70 degrees right. A prolonged right rudder input brought the bank angle to beyond 90 degrees. The airplane descended in a spiral dive and crashed into a mangrove swamp.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplane crashed after loss of control by the crew as a result of spatial disorientation (non recognized or subtle type transitioning to recognized spatial disorientation), after a long slow roll, during which no instrument scanning was done, and in the absence of external visual references in a dark night.  Inadequate operational control, lack of crew coordination, coupled with the non-adherence to procedures of flight monitoring, confusion in the utilization of the AP, have also contributed to cause this situation."""

It arrived at Toronto, Canada after a flight from Bombay, Delhi and Frankfurt.  In Toronto a 5th spare engine was fitted below the left wing. The engine had to be ferried for repairs in India. All passengers had disembarked for custom and immigration checks. Some passengers re-boarded the flight to continue to Montreal. A total of 270 passengers boarded the flight. In addition a fresh crew of 22 came aboard. The aircraft took off from Toronto runway 24L at 00:16 UTC. The flight to Montreal was uneventful and the airplane arrived at 01:10 UTC. Sixty-five passengers destined to Montreal along with three Air-India personnel deplaned at Montreal. The remaining 202 passengers remained on board the aircraft as transit passengers and were not allowed to disembark.  The flight number changed to AI 182 because the flight was heading back to Bombay with en route stops in London and Delhi. A total of 105 passengers boarded the flight through gate 80. The aircraft took off from Montreal at 02:18 UTC. Its estimated time of arrival at London was 08:33 UTC. At 07:15 UTC, at FL310 over the Atlantic Ocean an explosion occurred in the forward cargo compartment, causing a rapid decompression. The aft portion of the aircraft separated from the forward portion before striking the water. The wreckage sank to a depth of 6700 feet. From the wreckage retrieved no direct evidence was found of an explosive device. However, there is a considerable amount of circumstantial and other evidence that an explosive device caused the occurrence. Furthermore because an explosive device detonated in Tokyo the same day. Just 55 minutes before Air-India 182 crashed, A bag from CP Air Flight 003 exploded at Tokyo-Narita Airport, just 55 minutes before Air India 182 crashed. This was probably an interlined unaccompanied suitcase to be placed on Air-India Flight 301 to Bangkok. Investigation determined that a suitcase was also interlined unaccompanied from Vancouver via CP Air Flight 060 to Toronto. In Toronto, there is nothing to suggest that the suitcase was not transferred to Terminal 2 and placed on board Air India Flight 181/182 in accordance with normal practice. The aircraft departed Toronto for Montreal-Mirabel and London with the suitcase unaccompanied.  CONCLUSIONS The Canadian Aviation Safety Board respectfully submits as follows: Cause-Related Findings: 1. At 0714 GMT, 23 June 1985, and without warning, Air India Flight 182 was subjected to a sudden event at an altitude of 31,000 feet resulting in its crash into the sea and the death of all on board. 2. The forward and aft cargo compartments ruptured before water impact. 3. The section aft of the wings of the aircraft separated from the forward portion before water impact. 4. There is no evidence to indicate that structural failure of the aircraft was the lead event in this occurrence. 5. There is considerable circumstantial and other evidence to indicate that the initial event was an explosion occurring in the forward cargo compartment. This evidence is not conclusive. However, the evidence does not support any other conclusion."

The hiding place would have exposed the man to temperatures as low as 60C below freezing and oxygen deprivation during the 11-and-a-half-hour flight from Cape Town.  South Africa's airport operator ACSA reported that security personnel had discovered a young male within the perimeter of Cape Town's airport in the evening of Aug 22nd 2012 around the time the plane was departing, a chase started during which the person managed to escape and disappear."
Monday 12 August 1985,18:56,Boeing 747SR-46,Japan Air Lines - JAL,25030,520,"26 km SW of Ueno Village, Tano district, Gunma Prefecture - 
	   Japan",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT),Osaka-Itami Airport (ITM/RJOO),"JA8119 was a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747SR, a short range variant of the Boeing 747 Series 100. The was aircraft specifically configured for domestic flights with a high density seating arrangement.  On June 2, 1978 the aircraft operated on a flight to Osaka (ITM). It floated after touchdown and on the second touchdown the tail struck the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the rear underside of the fuselage. The rear pressure bulkhead was cracked as well. The aircraft was repaired by Boeing. Engineers replaced the lower part of the rear fuselage and a portion of the lower half of the bulkhead. Seven years later, on August 12, 1985, JA8119 had completed four domestic flights when it landed at Tokyo-Haneda (HND) at 17:17. The next flight was to be flight 123 to Osaka (ITM). The aircraft took off from Tokyo-Haneda at 18:12. Twelve minutes later, while climbing through 23900 feet at a speed of 300 knots, an unusual vibration occurred. An impact force raised the nose of the aircraft and control problems were experienced. A decompression had occurred and the crew got indications of problems with the R5 door. In fact, the rear pressure bulkhead had ruptured, causing serious damage to the rear of the plane. A portion of its vertical fin, measuring 5 m together with the section of the tailcone containing the auxiliary power unit (APU) were ripped off the plane. Due to the damage, the hydraulic pressure dropped and ailerons, elevators and yaw damper became inoperative. Controlling the plane was very difficult as the airplane experienced dutch rolls and phugoid oscillations (unusual movement in which altitude and speed change significantly in a 20-100 seconds cycle without change of angle of attack). The aircraft started to descend to 6600 feet while the crew tried to control the aircraft by using engine thrust. Upon reaching 6600 feet the airspeed had dropped to 108 knots. The aircraft then climbed with a 39 degree pitch-up to a maximum of approx. 13400 feet and started to descend again. At 18:56 JAL123 finally brushed against a tree covered ridge, continued and struck the Osutaka Ridge, bursting into flames.  CAUSE: ""It is estimated that this accident was caused by deterioration of flying quality and loss of primary flight control functions due to rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead of the aircraft, and the subsequent ruptures of a part of the fuselage tail, vertical fin and hydraulical flight control systems. The reason why the aft pressure bulkhead was ruptured in flight is estimated to be that the strength of the said bulkhead was reduced due to fatigue cracks propagating at the spliced portion of the bulkhead's webs to the extent that it became unable to endure the cabin pressure in flight at that time. The initiation and propagation of the fatigue cracks are attributable to the improper repairs of the said bulkhead conducted in 1978, and it is estimated that the fatigue cracks having not be found in the later maintenance inspection is contributive to their propagation leading to the rupture of the said bulkhead."""

American Airlines Flight 11 departed Boston-Logan for Los Angeles at 07:59. The aircraft was hijacked by five terrorists. The hijackers took over control, reportedly switched off the transponder and changed course to New York. At 08:46 the aircraft was flown into the North side of the 110-story New York WTC North tower in a slightly left wing down attitude, crashed and exploded into the 93rd through 98th floors. According to an FAA study, N334AA struck the WTC at a speed of 494 mph; an MIT study however determined the plane was probably traveling at 429 mph. The massive fire weakened the tower structure on these floors and the tower collapsed at 10:28. Most of the office workers below the 93th floor were able to evacuate the tower on time before the collapse. Seventeen minutes after Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower, the WTC South Tower was struck by a United Airlines Boeing 767, N612UA.  A total of 2,606 people were killed in the World Trade Center buildings, including about 292 on the ground.

All three on board were killed. The aircraft departed Miami International Airport, Florida at 11:33 hours local time (16:33 UTC) on a cargo flight to Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Texas, USA. The cruising altitude of FL400 was reached after 20 minutes. Descent towards Houston was commenced at 12:07 hours local time (18:07 UTC).  About 12:30 the pilots contacted the Houston terminal radar approach control (TRACON) arrival controller and reported descending for runway 26L; the airplane was at 17,800 ft with a ground speed 320 knots. As the flight descended toward the airport, the flight crew extended the speedbrakes, lowered the slats, and began setting up the flight management computer for the approach. The FO was the pilot flying, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the autopilot and autothrottle were engaged and remained engaged for the remainder of the flight.  At 12:34, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather. About 12:35, the flight was transferred to the Houston TRACON final controller, and the pilot reported they had received the Houston Automatic Terminal Information System weather broadcast. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors to runway 26L and asked if they wanted to go to the west or north of the weather. Radar data indicated the airplane continued the descent through 12,000 ft with a ground speed of 290 knots, consistent with the arrival procedure. The pilots responded that they wanted to go to the west of the area of precipitation. The controller advised that to do so, they would need to descend to 3,000 ft expeditiously. About 12:37, the controller instructed the pilots to turn to a heading of 270°. Radar data indicated the airplane turned, and the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated a selected heading of 270°. The airplane was descending through 8,500 ft at this time. About 12:38, the controller informed the pilots that they would be past the area of weather in about 18 miles, that they could expect a turn to the north for a base leg to the approach to runway 26L, and that weather was clear west of the precipitation area. The pilots responded, ""sounds good"" and ""ok.""  At this time, radar and ADS-B returns indicated the airplane levelled briefly at 6,200 ft and then began a slight climb to 6,300 ft. Also, about this time, the FDR data indicated that some small vertical accelerations consistent with the airplane entering turbulence.  At 12:38:31, the airplanes go-around mode was activated. Shortly after, when the airplanes indicated airspeed was steady about 230 knots, the engines increased to maximum thrust, and the airplane pitch increased to about 4° nose up. The airplane then pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49° in response to nose-down elevator deflection. The stall warning (stick shaker) did not activate. FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270°, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent.  The NTSB found that the first officers repeated uses of incomplete and inaccurate information about his employment history on resumes and applications were deliberate attempts to conceal his history of performance deficiencies and deprived Atlas Air and at least one other former employer of the opportunity to fully evaluate his aptitude and competency as a pilot. He had a long history of training performance difficulties and his tendency to respond impulsively and inappropriately when faced with an unexpected event during training scenarios at multiple employers suggest an inability to remain calm during stressful situations; a tendency that may have exacerbated his aptitude-related performance difficulties.  Probable Cause: The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captains failure to adequately monitor the airplanes flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industrys selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officers aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administrations failure to implement the Pilot Records Database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner."

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 00:41. At 00:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 00:50 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 01:07. Last radio contact was at 01:19 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam: ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied: ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero.""  At 01:21 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off.  At 01:38 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370. Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 02:22. From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 08:11 Malaysian time.  Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.  A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014. On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km.  On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. On August 5 it was established to have been from MH370.  The Team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370."

Flight 4101 climbed to the cruising altitude of FL140. The copilot contacted ATC at Sevilla and received clearance to descend to FL70. Two minutes later the flight was further cleared to 5000 feet and the crew were instructed to contact Melilla Tower. The copilot reported to the Melilla Tower controller that they were 30 nm from the airport, descending to 5000 feet.  Melilla Tower then reported that runway 33 was in use and reported wind at 270 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 8 km with few clouds at 1000 feet. At 06:45 the copilot reported that they were at 22nm at an altitude of 3000 feet. By now they had descended below the MSA of 4000 feet. The descent was continued and the airplane crossed the coast line at about 1100 feet. In IMC conditions the flight descended over mountainous terrain.

During the initial takeoff climb, the flight crew experienced a jammed thrust lever for the number 1 (left) engine and was unable to reduce the power. The captain notified air traffic control, and entered into a holding pattern, while the first officer and an accompanying company maintenance engineer unsuccessfully tried to rectify the jammed throttle problem. The captain decided to return to Kigali where, on a second attempt, a landing was performed on runway 28. The captain then taxied to the parking bay where he stopped the airplane, shut down the number 2 (right) engine; however the number 1 engine continued to operate at high power settings. The airplane taxied back to the apron. However as the ground crew went to put on the main gear wheel chocks, the aircraft suddenly accelerated, turned right knocking over blast fences until it hit the eastern wall of the VIP building after covering a distance of about 500 meters. After hitting the wall, the flight attendants aboard the aircraft initiated an evacuation sequence and the passengers escaped through the over-wing emergency door and walked away from the aircraft to the terminal building. The nose gear collapsed and the nose was buried inside the building up to and including the left hand forward passenger door.  Probable Cause: ""The flight crew's failure to identify corrective action and their lack of knowledge of applicable airplane and engine systems in response to a jammed thrust lever, which resulted in the number 1 engine operating at high power and the airplane configured in an unsafe condition that led to the need to apply heavy braking during landing. Also causal was the flightcrew failure to recognize the safety hazard that existed from overheated brakes and the potential consequence on the braking action needed to park the airplane. Contributing factors included the possible failure by maintenance crew to correctly stow the upper core cowl support strut after maintenance, Flightcrew's failure to follow standard operating procedures, the company's failure to be availed to manufacturer safety literature on the subject, and the susceptibility of the cowl core support shaft to interfere with the throttle control mechanism when the core strut is not in its stowed position."""

At about 08:47 local time, while heading 220 degrees and descending to 6000 ft the flight commenced a non-precision Non Directional Beacon (NDB) approach to runway 36. During the final inbound track at about 2.5 NM to the runway at 08:52, the EGPWS aural warning called out ""500"". The captain initiated ""Alt hold"" at about 08:53, just before the EGPWS alert ""100"" ""50"" 40"" ""30"" and the aircraft struck 66 KV power lines, trees, telephone cables, a fence and collided with terrain short of the runway, coming to rest approximately 0.7 NM from the threshold. During the ground collision, both wings separated and a fire commenced almost immediately. An emergency evacuation was initiated by the cabin crews. One aircraft occupant and one motorcyclist on the ground were fatally injured, 70 of the occupants and one motorcyclist survived and the aircraft was destroyed by fire.  Primary Cause: - During the final approach, the aircraft descended below the MDA and the crew did not follow the operator SOP's. - The pilots had no corrective action against to change VMC to IMC during bad weather condition and insufficient time for effective respond to last moment. Secondary Cause: - Captain of the aircraft had insufficient assessment on the risk that assigned the FO as PF. - There may be under pressure by the following aircrafts as the first plane on that day to Heho."

After the crew change, the flight took off from Lisbon at 03:32 UTC.  The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Descending towards Havana, the flight was vectored for an approach to runway 05. The aircraft turned onto runway heading at a distance of 9 km from the runway threshold. According to the approach procedure, the aircraft should have done so at 14-15 km from the threshold. During the approach the flight crew encountered a local fog bank. With the runway not in sight, the aircraft descended below the decision height of 150 m. At that point the aircraft was 3 km from the runway threshold.  The flight crew had not set their altimeters to the airfield pressure (QFE) of 752 mm Hg. This caused the aircraft to be lower than indicated. At a distance of 1,820 meters from the runway the aircraft hit  power lines, causing the aircraft to bank 70° to the right.

The aircraft had been chartered to carry out a return flight between Sheremetyevo Airport and Sochi. After completion of this flight, the aircraft was to be repositioned to the home base at Saint Petersburg. On takeoff, two seconds after rotation, the stabilizer trimmed to the full up (-12 degrees) position. This brought the aircraft in a  supercritical angle of attack, which could not be arrested by pushing the control column to the full forward position. The aircraft stalled and impacted the ground.  The cause could not be determined with certainty due to the almost complete destruction of the main and reserve stabilizer control system units as a result of the fire on the ground and lack of information on the primary and backup stabilizer control systems on the flight data recorder, and the lack of crew comments on the cockpit voice recorder. The accident of IL-86 RA-86060 could be caused by an electrical failure in the stabilizer control system, which led to the reverse control response when controlling the stabilizer from the main system or inadequate actions of one of the pilots, expressed in pressing and holding the ""pitch up"" stabilizer switch on the control column."

The crew were cleared for an ILS approach to Torrejon's runway 23. Weather was reported as 20,000 foot overcast, with 10 NM visibility. During the descent the crew forgot to use the Descent Checklist. Thus, the crew had failed to set their altimeters from 29.92"" to the local altimeter setting of 30.17"". Additionally, they did not turn on the radar altimeter. While at FL60 the crew was given a clearance to a lower altitude. Because of heavy radio traffic, the clearance was garbled. They were not sure if the controller had cleared them down to 5000 or 3000 feet. They agreed that it must have been 3000 feet. They read back ""three thousand feet"", but the controller failed to notice the error. When reporting ""passing 5000 for 3000"" to another controller, the error again was not noticed. Nearing 3000 feet, the navigator noticed a hill ahead and above their altitude, but the pilot reassured him that ""everything looks clear ahead"", with the lights of the air base visible in the valley below. At an altitude of 3050 feet, at a speed of 250 kts, the airplane impacted terrain near the edge of a plateau, 40 km east of the Torrejón Air Force Base. It became airborne again, rolled over and crashed into a ravine in an inverted attitude. At the time of the accident, the crew had spent only eight of the last 60 hours in bed.

The C-5 departed Saigon-Tan Son Nhut Airport at 16:03. Twelve minutes after takeoff, after climbing through FL230, there was what seemed to be an explosion as the lower rear fuselage was torn apart. The locks of the rear loading ramp had failed, causing the door to open and separate. A rapid decompression occurred. Control and trim cables to the rudder and elevators were severed, leaving only one aileron and wing spoilers operating. Two of the four hydraulic systems were out. The crew wrestled at the controls, managing to keep control of the plane with changes in power settings by using the one working aileron and wing spoilers. The crew descended to an altitude of 4,000 feet on a heading of 310 degrees in preparation for landing on Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. About halfway through a turn to final approach, the rate of descent increased rapidly to 4,000 feet per minute. Seeing they couldn't make the runway, full power was applied to bring the nose up. At 50 feet, the throttles where retarded to idle and the C-5 touched down in a rice paddy.

The airplane executed a takeoff from runway 06 to practice maneuvers for the upcoming 31 July 2010 Arctic Thunder Air Show. After the initial climb out and left turn, the pilot executed an aggressive right turn. As the aircraft banked, the stall warning system activated to alert the crew of an impending stall. Instead of implementing stall recovery procedures, the pilot continued the turn as planned, and the aircraft entered a stall from which recovery was not possible. Although the pilot eventually attempted to recover the aircraft, he employed incorrect procedures, and there was not sufficient altitude to regain controlled flight. The aircraft impacted wooded terrain northwest of the airfield, damaged a portion of the Alaskan Railroad, and was destroyed.  The board president found clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the mishap was pilot error. The pilot violated regulatory provisions and multiple flight manual procedures, placing the aircraft outside established flight parameters at an attitude and altitude where recovery was not possible. Furthermore, the copilot and safety observer did not realize the developing dangerous situation and failed to make appropriate inputs. In addition to multiple procedural errors, the board president found sufficient evidence that the crew on the flight deck ignored cautions and warnings and failed to respond to various challenge and reply items. The board also found channelized attention, overconfidence, expectancy, misplaced motivation, procedural guidance, and program oversight substantially contributed to the mishap."

The flight was conducted uneventfully and as the flight arrived in the Phuket area, the flight crew conducted the ILS runway 27 approach to the airport, with the first officer as the flying pilot. After the flight crew reported to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that they were established [on the] localizer, the crew that preceded the accident flight, reported information about the weather encountered during their approach. This information included an airspeed gain and loss of 15 knots during the final portion of the approach and noted a ""CB over the airport."" The flight crew of OG269 acknowledged the transmission and they were cleared to land at 15:37, with a wind report of 240 degrees at 15 knots.  One minute later, the controller issued another wind report, ""OTG269, strong wind 240 degrees 30 knots."" The pilot of OTG269 acknowledged the report, and shortly after, inquired again about the wind condition. The tower responded ""240 degrees 40 knots,"" and the pilot acknowledged the report. Information obtained from the CVR and FDR indicated that the flight crew conducted the ILS approach with the airplane aligned just to the north of the runway 27 centerline. Between 15:39:41 and 15:39:43, as the airplane was descending through 115 feet above threshold level, the airspeed dropped from 140 KCAS to 126 KCAS. At 15:39:43 the captain called for power, and the engine pressure ratio (EPR) subsequently increased toward 'go around thrust.' The EPR for both engines increased from about 1.16 to 2.0 in approximately three seconds and remained about 2.0 for the following 2 seconds, until about 15:39:48. Between 15:39:40 and 15:39:47, the pitch angle increased from 0 degrees to 5 degrees, and then decreased to about 2 degrees at 15:39:48. Despite the increase of thrust and pitch, the airplane continued to descend until about 15:39:48, reaching an altitude of 48 feet above threshold level before starting to climb. The airspeed increased during this time, from 126 KCAS at 15:39:43 to 166 KCAS at 15:39:48. At 15:39:47, the crew received a ""sink rate"" warning, and at 15:39:48, as the airplane descended below 50 feet, the autothrottle system initiated an automatic reduction of all engine thrust. The engine EPR decreased from 2.0 (go around thrust) at 15:39:48 to about 1.14 (idle thrust) at 15:39:53. At 15:39:49, the first officer called for a go-around, and the pitch of the airplane increased from about 2 degrees to about 12 degrees, as the airplane climbed. The thrust continued to decrease towards its idle position, while the airspeed decreased from 165 KCAS to about 122 KCAS at 15:39:57. At 15:39:50, the first officer transferred aircraft control to the captain as the thrust was reaching idle EPR. The EPR remained at the idle level for about 13 seconds, as the airplane continued to climb to a maximum altitude of 262 feet at 15:40:01, and then started descend again. During this time, the landing gear was retracted, and the flaps were set to 15 degrees; however, the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) switch was never pressed. The pitch angle decreased from 12 degrees to about 0 degrees, while the airspeed remained relatively constant at around 122 KCAS, with about +/- 4 knot excursions about this average. At 15:40:06, a dont sink warning sounded in the cockpit, as the airplane was descending through approximately 175 feet. The EPR began to increase again, reaching go around thrust at 15:40:09; however, the altitude and pitch continued to decrease. At 15:40:09, a sink rate warning, followed by a pull up warning sounded in the cockpit. During these warnings, the pitch began to increase from 0 degrees. The pitch increased to approximately 5 degrees over the next second, until the aircraft impacted the ground next to the runway at 15:40:11. The aircraft slid across a concrete ditch and burst into flames.  PROBABLE CAUSES: After thorough investigation, the AAIC determined that the probable causes of accident are as follows:  1. the flight crew did not follow the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of Stabilized Approach, Call Out, Go Around, and Emergency Situation as specified in the Airlines Flight Operation Manual (FOM).  2. the Take Off/ Go Around (TO/GA) switch was not pressed, resulting in the failure of increasing in airspeed and altitude during the go around. Also, there was no monitoring of the change in engine power and movement of throttle levers, especially during the emergency situation.  3. the flight crew co-ordination was insufficient and the flight crew had heavy workloads.  4. the weather condition changed suddenly over the airport vicinity.  5. the flight crew had accumulated stress, insufficient rest, and fatigue.  6. the transfer of aircraft control took place at a critical moment, during the go around."

	   Nigeria",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Abuja International Airport (ABV/DNAA),Lagos-Murtala Muhammed International Airport (LOS/DNMM),"A McDonnell Douglas MD-83 passenger plane, 5N-RAM, operated by Dana Air was destroyed when it crashed into a residential area of Lagos, Nigeria. All 147 passengers and six crew members were killed. There were 6 ground fatalities. The airplane was on the fourth flight segment of the day, consisting of two round-trips between Lagos and Abuja. The accident occurred during the return leg of the second trip. The first officer was Pilot Flying. Flight DAN992 initiated engine startup at 14:36, taxied to runway 04 at Abuja Airport and was later airborne at 14:58. Fuel endurance was 3.5 hours. The flight climbed to a cruise altitude of 26,000 ft. DAN992 made contact with Lagos Area Control Center at 15:18. At the time the captain and first officer were in a discussion of a nonnormal condition regarding the correlation between the engine throttle setting and an engine power indication. However, they did not voice concerns then that the condition would affect the continuation of the flight. The flight crew continued to monitor the condition and became increasingly concerned as the flight transition through the initial descent from cruise altitude at 15:22 and the subsequent approach phase. DAN992 reported passing through 18,100 at 15:30. Shortly afterwards the crew confirmed that there was no throttle response on the left engine and subsequently the Captain took over control as Pilot Flying (PF). The flight was however continued towards Lagos with no declaration of any distress message. With the confirmation of throttle response on the right engine, the engine anti-ice, ignition and bleed-air were all switched off. At 15:32, the crew observed the loss of thrust in engine no. 1. Between 15:37 and 15:41 the flight crew were engaged in pre-landing tasks including deployment of the slats, and extension of the flaps and landing gear. At 15:41:16 the first officer inquired, ""both engines coming up?"" and the captain replied ""negative."" The flight crew subsequently discussed and agreed to declare an emergency. At 15:42:10, DANA 992 radioed an emergency distress call indicating ""dual engine failure...negative response from throttle."" At 15:42:35, the flight crew lowered the flaps further and continued with the approach and discussed landing alternatively on runway 18L. At 15:42:45, the captain reported the runway in sight and instructed the first officer to raise the flaps and 4 seconds later to raise the landing gear. At 15:43:27 hours, the captain informed the first officer ""we just lost everything, we lost an engine. I lost both engines"". During the next 25 seconds the flight crew was attempting to restart the engines.  The airplane did not reach the runway and crashed in a residential area about 9,3 km short of the runway 18R. During the impact sequence, the airplane struck an incomplete building, two trees and three buildings. The wreckage was confined, with the separated tail section and engines located at the beginning of the debris field. A fire erupted.  An investigation by AIB Nigeria showed that the captain was employed by Dana Air on 14th March, 2012. He was originally from the United States, but was suspended in 2009 by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for some misdemeanours. It was noted that most of the recommendation letters submitted by the captain were also signed. Further, the line trainings that preceded the captain's checkout had a lot of adverse remarks made by the training captain. He started flying as checked out captain on 2nd May, 2012 and had accrued over 120 hours of flight time before the accident. Tear down of the engines showed that the no.1 engine was overhauled in the U.S in August 2011 and was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. Both engines had primary and secondary fuel manifold assemblies fractured, cracked, bent, twisted or pinched which led to fuel leaks, fuel discharge to bypass duct, loss of engine thrust and obvious failure of engine responding to throttle movement. This condition was similar to the no.1 engine of a different Dana Air MD-80, 5N-SAI, that was involved in an incident in October 2013 when the aircraft returned to the departure airport with the engine not responding th throttle movements. This engine also was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. This bulletin was issued in 2003 and called for the installation of new secondary fuel manifold assemblies, incorporating tubes fabricated from new material which has a fatigue life that was approximately 2 times greater than the previous tube material.  Probable Causal Factors: 1. Engine number 1 lost power seventeen minutes into the flight, and thereafter on final approach, Engine number 2 lost power and failed to respond to throttle movement on demand for increased power to sustain the aircraft in its flight configuration. 2. The inappropriate omission of the use of the Checklist, and the crews inability to appreciate the severity of the power-related problem, and their subsequent failure to land at the nearest suitable airfield. 3. Lack of situation awareness, inappropriate decision making, and poor airmanship."
Monday 8 October 2001,08:10,McDonnell Douglas DC-9-87 (MD-87),Scandinavian Airlines System - SAS,25573,110,"Milano-Linate Airport (LIN) - 
	   Italy",Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Milano-Linate Airport (LIN/LIML),København-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH),"A brand new Cessna 525A CitationJet 2, D-IEVX, arrived at Milan-Linate following a flight from Köln. The Cessna was to carry out a return flight to Paris-Le Bourget, carrying two pilots, a Cessna sales manager and a prospective customer. The plane arrived at 06:59 and was taxied to the General aviation apron, also known as 'West apron'. It was a foggy morning at Milan and one of the passenger flights parked on the North apron was SAS MD-87 ""Lage Viking"" which was being prepared for flight SK686 to Copenhagen, scheduled to depart at 07:35. At 07:41, the pilot of the MD-87 contacted Linate Ground Control for his engine start clearance, as the boarding of 104 passengers had been completed. The Ground controller cleared the pilot to start engines and advised that the slot time for takeoff of the flight was at 08:16. Thirteen minutes later flight 686 was cleared to taxi to runway 36R: ""Scandinavian 686 taxi to the holding position Cat III, QNH 1013 and please call me back entering the main taxiway.""  A few minutes later, the Cessna pilot requested permission to start the engines. The ground controller then gave start-up clearance. The ground controller then requested flight 686 to contact the Tower controller. From this moment on the crew of the MD-87 and the crew of the Cessna were tuned on two different radio frequencies. At 08:05 the pilots of the Cessna received taxi clearance: ""Delta Victor Xray taxi north via Romeo 5, QNH 1013, call me back at the stop bar of the ... main runway extension."" The pilot acknowledged by saying: ""Roger via Romeo 5 and ... 1013, and call you back before reaching main runway."" The Cessna started to taxi from the General Aviation parking position, following the yellow taxi line. After reaching the position where the yellow taxi line splits into two diverging directions, the pilot erroneously took the taxi line to right and entered taxiway R6. At 08:09 the Ground controller cleared the Cessna to continue its taxi on the North apron. At the same time the Tower controller cleared the MD-87 for takeoff: ""...Scandinavian 686 Linate, clear for take off 36, the wind is calm report rolling, when airborne squawk ident."" The pilot advanced the throttles and acknowledged the clearance: ""Clear for takeoff 36 at when...airborne squawk ident and we are rolling, Scandinavian 686."" When the MD-87 was speeding down the runway, the Cessna crossed the runway holding sign and entered the active runway 18L/36R. At 08.10:21 the nose landing gear of the MD-87 had left the ground and main gears were extending the shock absorbers but the main wheels were still on the ground at an airspeed of 146 knots (270,5 km/h).  At that moment the MD-87 crew probably saw a glimpse of the Cessna through the fog and reacted with  additional large nose-up elevator. At that moment the MD-87 collided with the CitationJet. The right wing of the MD-87 sustained damage at the leading edge and the right hand main landing gear leg broke off. It damaged the right flap and struck the no. 2 engine which then separated from the pylon. The pilot of the MD-87 gradually advanced the throttles and then the aircraft was airborne for a total of 12 seconds, reaching an estimated height of about 35 feet (11 meters). The left hand engine suffered a noticeable thrust reduction as a result of debris ingestion, which became insufficient to sustain flight. The airspeed had increased up to 166 knots (307,6 km/h), but the MD-87 descended abruptly making contact with the runway with the left hand maingear, the truncated right hand maingear leg and the tip of the right hand wing. Prior to touch down the pilot reduced engine thrust and after ground contact the engine reverse levers were activated and deployed (on the left hand engine only). Maximum available reverse thrust was selected and the brakes applied. The plane skidded past the grass overrun area, across a service road, crashing sideways into a baggage handling building, which partly collapsed. This building was located 20 m/67 feet to the right of the runway, and 460 m/1500 feet from the runway end.  CAUSES: ""After analysis of evidence available and information gathered, it can be assumed that the immediate cause for the accident has been the runway incursion in the active runway by the Cessna. The obvious consideration is that the human factor related action of the Cessna crew - during low visibility conditions - must be weighted against the scenario that allowed the course of events that led to the fatal collision; equally it can be stated that the system in place at Milano Linate airport was not geared to trap misunderstandings, let alone inadequate procedures, blatant human errors and faulty airport layout.  The following list highlights immediate and systemic causes that led to the accident: - the visibility was low, between 50 and 100 meters; - the traffic volume was high; - the lack of adequate visual aids; - the Cessna crew used the wrong taxiway and entered the runway without specific clearance; - the failure to check the Cessna crew qualification; - the nature of the flight might have exerted a certain pressure on the Cessna crew to commence the flight despite the prevailing weather conditions; - the Cessna crew was not aided properly with correct publications (AIP Italy - Jeppesen), lights (red bar lights and taxiway lights), markings (in deformity with standard format and unpublished, S4) and signs (non existing, TWY R6) to enhance their situational awareness; - official documentation failing to report the presence of unpublished markings (S4, S5, etc) that were unknown to air traffic controllers, thus preventing the ATC controller from interpreting the unambiguous information from the Cessna crew, a position report mentioning S4; - operational procedures allowing high traffic volume (high number of ground movements) in weather conditions as were current the day of the accident (reduced visibility) and in the absence of technical aids; - radio communications were not performed using standard phraseology (read back) or were not consistently adhered to (resulting in untraced misunderstandings in relevant radio communications); - radio communications were performed in Italian and English language; - Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel did not realize that Cessna was on taxiway R6; - the ground controller issued a taxi clearance towards Main apron although the reported position S4 did not have any meaning to him; - instructions, training and the prevailing environmental situation prevented the ATC personnel from having full control over the aircraft movements on ground.  Furthermore: - the aerodrome standard did not comply with ICAO Annex 14; required markings, lights and signs did either not exist (TWY R6) or were in dismal order and were hard to recognize especially under low visibility conditions (R5-R6), other markings were unknown to operators (S4); - no functional Safety Management System was in operation; - the competence maintenance and requirements for recent experience for ATC personnel did not fully comply with ICAO Annex 1; - the LVO implementation by ENAV (DOP 2/97) did not conform with the requirements provided in the corresponding and referenced ICAO DOC 4976.  The combined effect of these factors, contemporaneously present on the 8th of October 2001 at Milano Linate, have neutralized any possible error corrective action and therefore allowed the accident."""

Hartsfield International Airport, GA (ATL/KATL)","Delta Flight 1288 was a domestic flight from Pensacola (PNS) to Atlanta (ATL). The MD-88 taxied to runway 17 and was cleared for takeoff at 14:23.  The first officer, who was the pilot flying, advanced the throttles and called for the autothrottles to be set when the engine pressure ratio (EPR) reached 1.35. The throttles were advancing in the autothrottle mode when the flightcrew heard a ""loud bang,"" followed by the loss of cockpit lighting and instrumentation. The airplane had reached a speed of about 40 knots. The captain took control of the airplane and retarded both throttles to idle. He applied manual brakes and brought the airplane to a gradual stop on the runway. The captain did not command reverse engine thrust, and the ground spoilers were not deployed. It appeared that the no. 1 engine of the aircraft suffered an uncontained failure. Debris entered the passenger cabin, causing the death of two passengers seated at row 37 (seats A and C).  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The fracture of the left engines front compressor fan hub, which resulted from the failure of Delta Air Lines fluorescent penetrant inspection process to detect a detectable fatigue crack initiating from an area of altered microstructure that was created during the drilling process by Volvo for Pratt & Whitney and that went undetected at the time of manufacture. Contributing to the accident was the lack of sufficient redundancy in the in-service inspection program."""
Tuesday 24 August 1999,12:36,McDonnell Douglas MD-90-30,Uni Air,4929,1,"Hualien Airport (HUN) - 
	   Taiwan",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Songshan Airport (TSA/RCSS),Hualien Airport (HUN/RCYU),"As the MD-90 touched down following a 25-minute flight from Taipeh, there was a loud noise from the front of the cabin and thick black smoke poured from one of the overhead luggage compartments on the right hand side of the plane. Insulation and charred luggage littered the runway. Passengers were swiftly evacuated, but it took firefighters more than half an hour to control the fire. Twenty-eight people were injured. Preliminary investigation reports in 1999 indicated that the blast was caused by two bottles of household bleach. However, the Hualien District Court judges decided the bottles contained gasoline. According to the judges, Ku Chin-shui had put the gasoline into two plastic bleach bottles and gave them to his nephew. The gasoline leaked during the flight and exploded when it caused a short-circuit in a motorbike battery in a nearby overhead luggage compartment. In July 2003 Ku appealed a seven-and-a-half-year prison term. Considering the prosecutor's case against Ku to be full of holes, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A flammable liquid (gasoline) inside bleach and softener bottles and sealed with silicone was carried on board the aircraft. A combustible vapor formed as the leaking gasoline filled the stowage bin, and the impact of the landing aircraft created a short in a battery. The short ignited the gasoline vapor and created the explosion. Contributing factors to the accident were: The Civil Aeronautical Administration Organic Regulations and its operational bylaws fail to designate any entity as responsible for hazardous materials.; The Aviation Police fail to properly recruit and train personnel, to include preparing training materials and evaluating training performance. Some new recruits were found to have not received any formal security check training, but instead were following instructions from senior inspectors. Consequently, new inspectors cannot be relied upon to identify hazardous materials.; The detectors and inspectors failed to detect the hazardous materials. The detectors used by the Aviation Police did not detect the banned motorcycle batteries, nor did security inspectors detect the liquid bleach, a banned corrosive substance."""
Thursday 19 May 1960,09:46,Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle IA,Air Algérie,315,1,"13 km SE of Paris-Orly Airport (ORY) - 
	   France",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Algiers-Maison Blanche Airport (ALG/DAAG),Paris-Orly Airport (ORY/LFPO),"After a normal trip out of Algiers radio communications were discontinued with the Paris control centre (procedure Juliett) and the aircraft reported to Orly. It was cleared to enter the pattern in descent in visual flight for a landing on runway 20, rounded the OE marker in descent and prepared to make its last turn before final approach. At a level of about 3600 feet, with air brakes extended, rate of descent reduced (1500 to 1000 feet per minute), decreasing airspeed (260 kt) in order to extend the flaps, after emerging from the cloud cover the aircraft had just passed the OE marker and was on a heading of 300/290. The pilot-in-command was attempting to catch sight of a Convair on his left (in communication with the tower and also on approach for runway 20 Left), as well as of his runway, for the last turn into alignment. The co-pilot, while preparing to display his heading data, at that moment saw a light aircraft, green in colour, in the right fore sector, slightly high and very close, despite his action of pushing on the control column, collision followed immediately. The accident occurred 13 km from the Orly tower. The Stampe SV-4C biplane (F-BDEV of the University Aeronautical Club, flying from Challes to Saint-Cyr) was shattered, and the wreckage fell to the ground. The cabin roof of the Caravelle was torn open, and the engine of the Stampe was thrown inside. The two jet engines, which were on a descent setting of 5100 rpm were stopped by the debris absorbed and the damage caused to them, particularly on the right, where a wheel of the Stampe wedged in the intake. (The Caravelle's tail parachute, opened by the impact, was automatically released.) The engineer was successful in restarting the engines, obtaining 8000 rpm on the left and 5 000 rpm on the right. The aircraft, with its radio out of commission, completed its approach and landed without further manoeuvring difficulties at 0450.  The Stampe (F-BDEV of the University Aeronautical Club) was flying from Challes to Saint-Cyr at 1000 m altitude at a 200deg heading. The Caravelle sustained substantial damage to the forward upper part of the fuselage but landed safely. The Stampe crashed.  CONCLUSIONS: ""Literal application of the Rules of the Air (RAC 1 -3-02) elicits the statement that it was incumbent on both pilots-in-command to avoid collisions that the pilot of the Stampe, being on the the right, had the right-of-way (RAC 1-3-02 of 1 July 1959). However, the results of the inquiry, lead to the contention that such regulations are no longer adapted to the speeds and procedures practiced by jet aircraft, the pilots of which cannot be sure of avoiding any risk of collision by visual means alone."""

All 45 on board were killed.  A flight plan had been filed for an IFR flight from Halim Airport to Pelabuhan Ratu area then return to Halim Airport.  The flight departed Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH) at 14:21. It flew south and circled Mount Salak (elevation 7254 feet). After circling the mountain, the airplane began to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet. Last contact with the flight was at 14:30. The wreckage was found the following morning on a near-vertical mountainside on the eastern side of Mount Salak at an elevation of 6,100 feet.   The Superjet was conducting a demonstration flight to prospective customers in several countries. Demonstrations were flown in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan before arriving in Indonesia on May 9. Two demonstration flights were planned. The first flight was uneventful. Passengers on the second flight were reporters and representatives of several Indonesian airlines. There were six crew members on board, two representatives of Sukhoi and 37 journalists and prospective clients.  FACTORS: a. The crew were not aware of the mountainous area surrounding the flight path due to various factors resulting in disregarding the TAWS warning.  b. The Jakarta Radar service had not established the minimum vectoring altitudes and the system was not equipped with functioning MSAW for the particular area surrounding Mount Salak.  c. Distraction to the flight crew from prolonged conversation not related to the progress of the flight resulted in the pilot flying did not continue to change the aircraft heading while in orbit. Consequently, the aircraft unintentionally exited the orbit."

At the end of the runway the aircraft entered a steep climb. While the canards on the forward fuselage were being retracted, the Tu-144 entered a steep dive. The disturbed airflow may have caused one or more engines to flame out. In order to regain control the canards were deployed again. The crew tried to pull out of the dive, causing the overstressing of the airframe. The left canard-wing is reported to have separated, striking the wing and puncturing the fuel tank. The Tupolev broke up and crashed in flames into the small town of Goussainville. It appears that, for safety reasons, the Tupolev factory had restricted the control surface deflection to a maximum of 5 degrees with canards extended. For the second day of the show Tupolev wanted a more impressive flight demonstration, certainly in comparison with the other supersonic transport (SST) at the air show: Concorde. Engineers thus disabled the 5-degree limitation. A latent erroneous set-up of the auto-stabilizer electronics now could have serious effects. After retraction of the canards the auto-stabiliser reacted by deflecting the elevons 10 degrees down. This caused the SST to enter a sudden dive."

The captain, copilot, flight engineer and two flight attendants were killed. The remaining three crew members sustained serious injuries. The airplane departed Pardubice Airport (PED), Czech Republic about 11:10 local time as Red Wings Airlines flight RWZ9268 to Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO).   Flight 9268 approached from the north and was cleared for landing on runway 19. The airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps at -37°, slats at -23°, and landing gear down. Decision height was 60 metres and the planned final approach speed was 210 km/h (113 kts). The final approach was flown in director mode with disabled automatic throttle. The approach was flown unstabilized at a speed of 255 km/h (138 kts) without significant deviations from the glide path. The airplane passed the runway threshold at a height of 15 meters (50 ft) and an airspeed of 260 km/h (140 kts). The throttles were moved to the 'idle' position and the airplane touched down at a speed of 230 km/h (124 kts), at a distance of about 900 - 1000 m (2950-3280 ft) from the threshold of the 3060 m (10.040 ft) long runway. The aircraft touched down on the left hand main gear first while the wind was gusting to about 11,5 m/sec. When the nose gear touched down, the right hand undercarriage strut had not yet compressed. Immediately the crew moved the throttle levers to ""maximum reverse"". The thrust reversers did not deploy. Also, the air brakes and spoilers did not deploy automatically. After selecting maximum reverse, thrust was increased to 90% (nominal operation). The minimum speed on landing was 200-205 km/h (108-111 kts). After that the speed increased to 240 km/h (130 kts). The increase in speed led to additional ""unloading"" of the main landing gear. The airplane rolled left and right but there was no simultaneous touchdown of both main landing gears. The pilots used the brakes but they were ineffective because the pressure in the wheel brakes is only applied when both landing gear struts are compressed.  Five seconds after switching off the ""maximum reverse"", the flight engineer requested the reversers be activated again. Maximum reverse was selected again with the engines spooling up to 84% thrust. The reversers still failed to deploy. Thirty-two seconds after touchdown the airplane had reached the end of the runway. It crossed the runway threshold at a speed of 215 km/h (116 kts). The flight engineer shut down the engines at the request of the captain. Then both landing gear struts compressed, causing the automatic release of air brakes and spoilers as well as the deployment of the thrust reversers.  The distance between the end of the runway and the M3 highway embankment is about 320 m (1050 ft) on downsloping terrain with a sharp dropoff of 10 metres (33 ft) at the embankment. The airplane collided with the embankment at a speed of 190 km/h (103 kts). It broke in three and the forward part of the fuselage came to rest on the highway.  It had been snowing prior to the accident and there was a significant cross wind with gusts up to 29 knots.  Runway 24 was closed since 19 December according to an airport Notam: ""A5127/12 - RWY 06/24 CLSD FOR TKOF AND LDG OF ALL TYPES ACFT. 19 DEC 06:30 2012 UNTIL 31 MAR 23:59 2013. CREATED: 19 DEC 07:46 2012""  The accident was caused by misadjustment of reverse thrust control units of both engines and incorrect (inconsistent with the airplanes flight manual) control of ground spoilers and thrust reverse by the crew during the landing roll, which prevented proper braking action, causing runway excursion and collision with obstacles at high speed (ca. 190 km/h), destruction of the airplane and death of the crew members. (According to the Manual of Aviation Accident Investigation (ICAO Doc 9756 AN/965, causes and contributing factors are listed in logical order without assessment of priorities).  Contributing factors: 1) Stiffness of the reverse thrust control and locking mechanism that can manifest itself only during improper reverse thrust control by the crew and that is not mentioned in the maintenance manual section covering adjustments after engine change. 2) Contradictions between the aircraft and engine maintenance manuals and a continuous neglectful attitude to engine control system checks and adjustments (including the reverser control and locking mechanism) by organizations responsible for engine replacement, making it impossible for aircraft and engine developers to receive feedback and correct flaws. 3) Unstabilized approach with significantly exceeded (up to 45 km/h) speed on finals ultimately resulting in a prolonged flare and touchdown 950 m past the designated point. 4) Failure of spoilers and speedbrakes automatic deployment due to absence of the simultaneous both main gear Weight-On-Wheels signal caused by initial 'soft' left wheel touchdown (1.12g) in extreme conditions of 11.5 m/s right crosswind. 5) Failure of flight crew to verify the automatic spoilers and speedbrakes deployment after touchdown and to deploy them manually. 6) Flight manual violation regarding the use of reverse thrust by the crew applying maximum reverse in a 'single input' without setting the lever into intermediate position and failing to verify deployment of the reversers, which in turn led to forward thrust increase due to aforementioned reverse thrust control and locking mechanism flaw. 7)  Absence of the simultaneous Weight-On-Wheels signal for both main landing gear struts during the whole landing roll due to specific sensors design (no sensor failure occured; each strut load must exceed 5,5 t) and crews failure to extend spoilers manually that prevented reversers to deploy. 8) Captains  unsatisfactory crew management during the whole flight eventually resulting in unstabilized approach and during the landing roll concentration on the reverse thrust engaging leaving other systems unattended. 9) Failure to timely implement preventive measures after the 20.12.2012 Tu-204 RA-64049 Red Wings serious incident at Tolmachevo airport. 10) Unsatisfactory management level and insufficient safety procedures inside the Red Wings airline, as well as the assigned pilot-instructors neglectful attitude to the captains proficiency check and absence of the proper proficiency check inspection, which in turn made it impossible to determine and eliminate systematic captains piloting deficiencies regarding exceeding approach speed on final, as well as the reverse thrust lever inputs technique after touchdown. Assessment monitoring described in Federal Aviation Rules-128 5.7 had not been performed. 11) Absence of the periodical training program concerning standard procedures in case of Weight-On-Wheels sensor failures resulting in failure of spoilers and speedbrakes to deploy. Existing simulators are not capable of modeling this kind of situation."

	   Greece",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Odessa-Central Airport (ODS/UKOO),Thessaloniki International Airport (SKG/LGTS),"AeroSvit Airlines Flight 241 was a scheduled service from Kiev, Ukraine to Thessaloniki, Greece with an en route stop at Odessa,  Ukraine. The first leg of the flight was operated by a Boeing 737. Because of engine problems, an aircraft change had to be made at  Odessa. The last leg of the flight was carried out using a Yakovlev 42 (UR-42334), which was being chartered from Lvovskie avialinii. The flight crew had no previous experience in flying to Thessaloniki. The flight was dispatched from Odessa with the No 1 VHF/NAV receiver inoperative, which was contrary to the minimum equipment list (MEL), and took off at 17:23 hours UTC.   The weather conditions at Thessaloniki Airport were above required approach and landing minima, however, darkness and an overcast cloud layer obscured awareness of mountainous terrain in the area. The flight was instructed by the approach controller to conduct the LAMBI1F standard arrival procedure and was cleared to execute a VOR-DME-ILS approach to runway 16. The aircraft did not follow the ""19 DME arc"" as required by the approach procedure, but proceeded directly to the THS NDB. It overshot the localizer course at least twice and the flight crew were unable to establish a stabilized approach.  According to the CVR cockpit conversations, the flight crew was confused and uncertain with respect to the navigation aids and the information that was presented. During the approach there were no standard callouts made by the flight crew related to the glide slope, outer marker or minima. At 18:54 UTC the Thessaloniki Tower controller reported that they had passed the airport. The flight crew was unaware that they overflew the runway until they were informed by the controller. The flight crew then initiated a go-around but did not follow the published missed approach procedure, nor did they follow the instructions given by the ATC. Although instructed by ATC to proceed to, and enter the south holding pattern, the flight continued on a flight path to the west. The flight crew remained confused, disorganized, and disoriented during the missed approach and the subsequent clearances issued by ATC. They had lost situational and terrain awareness, and they were uncertain with respect to the radio navigation aids and the information that was presented. They also requested ""route vectors"" and ""heading"" twice although Thessaloniki Airport was a non-radar facility. The flight crew occasionally was confused in reading and reporting the correct distances on their DME equipment (miles to kilometers and vice versa) as their instruments displayed distances in kilometers.  The flight crew in their effort to solve the navigational problem, often switched their focus from VOR/DME information to ADF, and vice versa. This, in conjunction with the VHF/NAV receiver malfunction, contributed greatly to the confusion in the cockpit and to the loss of orientation. At 19:12 UTC the GPWS sounded for 4 seconds. At the same time the approach controller radioed: ""AEW number one, continue VOR-DME/ILS approach minima, continue and report approaching the outer marker"". The crew replied: ""Outer marker will be report`. After a while the approach controller asked: ""AEW-241, do you have the field in sight?"". At that time the GPWS sounded again.  Shortly afterwards the aircraft impacted the side of Mount Pente Pigadia at 3300 feet.   The wreckage was found at 10:30 hours, December 20. At the same date a Greek Air Force Lockheed Hercules, which was being used in the search, crashed, killing all 5 on board.  On October 6, 2000 a trial began with two air traffic controllers being accused of many counts of manslaughter and of violating the transportation regulations. They were sentenced to five years imprisonment. In December 2002 a Thessaloniki appeals court reduced the sentences of two air traffic controllers to four years and four months each.  Causes: 1. The failure of the flight crew to adequately plan and execute the approach and missed approach procedure for runway 16 at Makedonia airport. 2. The failure of the flight crew to properly utilize the Makedonia airport radionavigational aids and aircraft radio equipment / instruments and to interpret the information that was presented. 3. The failure of the flight crew to declare an emergency when they lost their orientation following the missed approach, despite numerous cues alerting them for the aforementioned situation. 4. The captain's failure to achieve maximum performance climb in response to the GPWS alarm signal, 30"" prior to impact. 5. The lack of command presence, cockpit discipline and resource management which resulted in a disorganized, confused and ultimately disfunctional flight crew. 6. The company's inadequate oversight, over their flight operations, that allowed for and resulted in scheduling one inadequately prepared and marginally qualified flight crew and an aircraft which did not comply with national and international airworthiness regulations (it had not been issued the Type Certificate with the corresponding Amendment for the international flights), to execute a regular passenger flight with No 1 VHF/NAV receiver inoperative.  Contributing Factors: 1. The inadequate training provided to the flight crew for cockpit resource management and international flight operations. 2. The dispatch of the aircraft with No 1 VHF/NAV receiver, inoperative, despite the restrictions provided in M.E.L. (Appendix 28, pages 14, 16). 3. The assignment of a marginally qualified instructor pilot to this specific flight who disrupted and substantially reduced the coordination and effectiveness of the flight crew. 4. The inaccurate display of the symbol (R) on the Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. chart 11-1, for runway 16, from which the flight crew, most probably, have formed the wrong impression that radar service was available in Makedonia airport. 5. The insufficient evaluation by the Approach Control, under the aforementioned circumstances, of the difficulties encountered by the flight crew in following procedures and clearances, which prevented the Controllers to offer any available assistance, by their own initiative, in order to prevent, probably, the accident."

All 196 on board and seven persons on the ground were killed. The aircraft originated from Denpasar Airport, Indonesia and was bound for Taipei. The flight was cleared for an ILS/DME runway 05L approach to Taipei Chiang Kai Shek Airport in light rain and fog. The aircraft remained high on the approach. At 1,2nm short of the threshold, the altitude was 1515 feet, whereas it should have been at 500 feet at that point. The flight crew selected full flaps. At 20:04:50 hours local time the autopilot was disconnected. Subsequently, as the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 1475 feet, go around thrust was applied. The aircraft rapidly pitched up, reaching +35° as it climbed trough 1723 feet at an airspeed of 134 knots. The gear had just been raised and the flaps set to 20 degrees. At 20:05:16 the aircraft had reached 2327 feet at a +42.7° pitch. Nine seconds later the speed had fallen to 43 knots as the aircraft stalled. The aircraft nosed down with a 79° left bank. The flight crew was not able to regain control and the aircraft impacted the ground left of the runway. It hit a utility pole and a highway median and then skidded into several houses, surrounded by fish farms, rice paddies, factories and warehouses. A fire erupted.  Visibility at the time of the accident was 2400 feet, the runway 05L RVR (runway visual range) was 3900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3000 feet overcast.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The investigation team determined that the the following factors combination caused the accident:  1. during all the descent and the approach, the aircraft was higher than the normal path;  2. the crew coordination between the captain and the first officer was inadequate. 3. during 12 seconds, the crew did not counteract the pitch up tendency due to the thrust increase after go around, and then the reaction of the crew was not sufficient.  As a consequence the pitch up increased until the aircraft stalled."""

	   Atlantic Ocean",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport, RJ (GIG/SBGL)",Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG),"An Air France Airbus A330-200 was destroyed when it crashed into the sea while on transatlantic flight from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport, RJ (GIG) to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). All occupants, 12 crew members an 216 passengers, were killed.  Air France flight 447 departed at 19:29 hours local time (May 31) from Rio de Janeiro. The takeoff weight was 232.8t (for a MTOW of 233 t), including 70.4 tonnes of fuel. One of the co-pilots was Pilot Flying (PF). The flight progressed as planned with the crew contacting several air traffic control centres along the way. Cruising altitude was FL350. At 23:35 local time (01:35 UTC), the crew informed the Atlantic Area Control Centre (CINDACTA III) controller that they had passed the INTOL waypoint. INTOL is an RNAV waypoint located in the Atlantic Ocean, 565 km from Natal, Brazil.  At 01:48 UTC the aircraft went out of the radar coverage of CINDACTA III, Fernando de Noronha. The meteorological situation in the area of AF447's flight path over the Atlantic was typical of that encountered in the month of June in the inter-tropical convergence zone. There were powerful cumulonimbus clusters on the route of AF447. Some of them could have been the centre of some notable turbulence. At 01:55, the captain woke the second co-pilot and said ""[...] hes going to take my place"". The captain then attended the briefing between the two co-pilots, during which the Pilot Flying said, in particular ""the little bit of turbulence that you just saw [...] we should find the same ahead [...] were in the cloud layer unfortunately we cant climb much for the moment because the temperature is falling more slowly than forecast"" and that ""the logon with Dakar failed"". The captain left the cockpit at 02:01:46 UTC.  The airplane was flying at FL350 and at Mach 0.82 and the pitch attitude was about 2.5 degrees. Autopilot 2 and auto-thrust were engaged. At 02:06:04, the PF called the cabin crew, telling them that ""in two minutes we should enter an area where itll move about a bit more than at the moment, you should watch out"" and he added ""Ill call you back as soon as were out of it"". At 02:08:07, the PNF said ""you can maybe go a little to the left [...]"". The airplane began a slight turn to the left, the change in relation to the initial route being about 12 degrees. The level of turbulence increased slightly and the crew decided to reduce the speed to about Mach 0.8. From 02:10:05, the autopilot then auto-thrust disengaged and the PF said ""I have the controls"". The airplane began to roll to the right and the PF made a left nose-up input. The stall warning sounded twice in a row. The recorded parameters show a sharp fall from about 275 kt to 60 kt in the speed displayed on the left primary flight display (PFD), then a few moments later in the speed displayed on the integrated standby instrument system (ISIS).  At 02:10:16, the PNF said ""so, weve lost the speeds"" then ""alternate law [...]"".  The airplanes pitch attitude increased progressively beyond 10 degrees and the plane started to climb. The PF made nose-down control inputs and alternately left and right roll inputs. The vertical speed, which had reached 7,000 ft/min, dropped to 700 ft/min and the roll varied between 12 degrees right and 10 degrees left. The speed displayed on the left side increased sharply to 215 kt (Mach 0.68). The airplane was then at an altitude of about 37,500 ft and the recorded angle of attack was around 4 degrees. From 02:10:50, the PNF tried several times to call the captain back.  At 02:10:51, the stall warning was triggered again. The thrust levers were positioned in the TO/GA detent and the PF maintained nose-up inputs. The recorded angle of attack, of around 6 degrees at the triggering of the stall warning, continued to increase. The trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) passed from 3 to 13 degrees nose-up in about 1 minute and remained in the latter position until the end of the flight. Around fifteen seconds later, the speed displayed on the ISIS increased sharply towards 185 kt; it was then consistent with the other recorded speed. The PF continued to make nose-up inputs. The airplanes altitude reached its maximum of about 38,000 ft, its pitch attitude and angle of attack being 16 degrees. At around 02:11:40, the captain re-entered the cockpit. During the following seconds, all of the recorded speeds became invalid and the stall warning stopped. The altitude was then about 35,000 ft, the angle of attack exceeded 40 degrees and the vertical speed was about -10,000 ft/min. The airplanes pitch attitude did not exceed 15 degrees and the engines' N1's were close to 100%. The airplane was subject to roll oscillations that sometimes reached 40 degrees. The PF made an input on the sidestick to the left and nose-up stops, which lasted about 30 seconds. At 02:12:02, the PF said ""I dont have any more indications"", and the PNF said ""we have no valid indications"". At that moment, the thrust levers were in the IDLE detent and the engines' N1's were at 55%. Around fifteen seconds later, the PF made pitch-down inputs. In the following moments, the angle of attack decreased, the speeds became valid again and the stall warning sounded again. At 02:13:32, the PF said ""were going to arrive at level one hundred"". About fifteen seconds later, simultaneous inputs by both pilots on the sidesticks were recorded and the PF said ""go ahead you have the controls"".  The angle of attack, when it was valid, always remained above 35 degrees. The recordings stopped at 02:14:28. The last recorded values were a vertical speed of -10,912 ft/min, a ground speed of 107 kt, pitch attitude of 16.2 degrees nose-up, roll angle of 5.3 degrees left and a magnetic heading of 270 degrees. The airplane struck the surface of the sea.  Several attempts were made to locate the wreckage of the airplane. Finally on April 2, 2011, a search vessel using unmanned submarines located pieces of wreckage including an engine, landing gear and fuselage and wing parts on the Ocean floor. The flight recorders were recovered on May 2, 2011.  CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT: The obstruction of the Pitot probes by ice crystals during cruise was a phenomenon that was known but misunderstood by the aviation community at the time of the accident. From an operational perspective, the total loss of airspeed information that resulted from this was a failure that was classified in the safety model. After initial reactions that depend upon basic airmanship, it was expected that it would be rapidly diagnosed by pilots and managed where necessary by precautionary measures on the pitch attitude and the thrust, as indicated in the associated procedure. The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the pilots of flight AF 447. The apparent difficulties with aeroplane handling at high altitude in turbulence led to excessive handling inputs in roll and a sharp nose-up input by the PF. The destabilisation that resulted from the climbing flight path and the evolution in the pitch attitude and vertical speed was added to the erroneous airspeed indications and ECAM messages, which did not help with the diagnosis. The crew, progressively becoming de-structured, likely never understood that it was faced with a 'simple' loss of three sources of airspeed information. In the minute that followed the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempts to understand the situation and the de-structuring of crew cooperation fed on each other until the total loss of cognitive control of the situation. The underlying behavioural hypotheses in classifying the loss of airspeed information as 'major' were not validated in the context of this accident. Confirmation of this classification thus supposes additional work on operational feedback that would enable improvements, where required, in crew training, the ergonomics of information supplied to them and the design of procedures. The aeroplane went into a sustained stall, signalled by the stall warning and strong buffet. Despite these persistent symptoms, the crew never understood that they were stalling and consequently never applied a recovery manoeuvre. The combination of the ergonomics of the warning design, the conditions in which airline pilots are trained and exposed to stalls during their professional training and the process of recurrent training does not generate the expected behaviour in any acceptable reliable way. In its current form, recognizing the stall warning, even associated with buffet, supposes that the crew accords a minimum level of 'legitimacy' to it. This then supposes sufficient previous experience of stalls, a minimum of cognitive availability and understanding of the situation, knowledge of the aeroplane (and its protection modes) and its flight physics. An examination of the current training for airline pilots does not, in general, provide convincing indications of the building and maintenance of the associated skills. More generally, the double failure of the planned procedural responses shows the limits of the current safety model. When crew action is expected, it is always supposed that they will be capable of initial control of the flight path and of a rapid diagnosis that will allow them to identify the correct entry in the dictionary of procedures. A crew can be faced with an unexpected situation leading to a momentary but profound loss of comprehension. If, in this case, the supposed capacity for initial mastery and then diagnosis is lost, the safety model is then in 'common failure mode'. During this event, the initial inability to master the flight path also made it impossible to understand the situation and to access the planned solution. Thus, the accident resulted from the following succession of events: - Temporary inconsistency between the airspeed measurements, likely following the obstruction of the Pitot probes by ice crystals that, in particular, caused the autopilot disconnection and the reconfiguration to alternate law; - Inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path; - The lack of any link by the crew between the loss of indicated sp"

One of the nine crew members survived the accident. The aircraft performed a certification flight out of Kiev's Gostomel Airport. The mission for the flight was to carry out tests to determine the characteristics of controllability at maximum speed. In the test flight zone at an altitude of 5800 m (19000 feet), the crew proceeded to accelerate from 530 km/h to 650 km/h with the steering wheel completely deflected to the right. At a speed of 614 km/h, the radome disintegrated. This caused the nose to break open and separate, leading to a sudden loss of airspeed along with strong vibration and noise in the cabin. Debris was ingested in engine no. 3. The engine shut down automatically and, as a consequence, the 3rd hydraulic system failed. This, in turn, led to numerous failures of aircraft systems, including the flight management system. The crew did not get valid data about speed, altitude and angle of attack while trying to manage the emergency. When increasing power to engines no. 2 and 4, there was a surging of engine no. 4, the air intake of which also contained fragments of the nose fairing.  The crew increased power on engine no. 1 to 58%, which led to a significant lateral slip. Control became very difficult with the aircraft oscillating. The captain instructed the engineers to leave the aircraft with parachutes. One engineer who was in the back cabin, left the aircraft through the emergency hatch. He survived with serious injuries. The flight continued back towards Gostomel for an emergency landing. An Antonov An-22 began flying in a parallel course, helping the crew to determine their airspeed. Because the speed was much higher than the landing speed, the captain ordered to select flaps. However, due to asymmetrical release of flaps, descent rate increased. The aircraft collided with trees up to 30-40 m high, fell into a forest 43 km west of Gostomel. All the eight remaining crew members and engineers were killed.  Unconfirmed reports suggest the initial failure of the nose radome was caused by a bird strike (with the bird weighing about  1.8 kg)."

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 14:21 hours local time (11:21 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on.  After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet). About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater. After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease. The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g. The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 14:27:05 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h.  The captain of the An-148 had 2168 hours on type, of which 58 as captain. The first officer had 672 hours on type.  The AN-148-100V RA-61704 crash occurred due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions at unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing (blockage of ice) of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control over the parameters of the aircraft, its transfer to dive and collision with the ground. The accident was classified as a loss of control in flight (LOC-I).  The investigation revealed systemic weaknesses in the identification of hazards and risk control, the inoperability of the airline's flight safety management system and the lack of control over the level of training of crew members by aviation authorities at all levels, which led to the issuance of certificates of aviation personnel and the admission to the flights of the crew, which did not fully meet the qualification requirements.  The most likely contributing factors were: - Hurry of the crew in preparation for the flight due to the late arrival of the aircraft from the previous flight and attempts to ""catch up"" with the time; - Skipping by the crew of the operation to switch on the pitot tube heating before takeoff and failing to comply with the section of the check list ""BEFORE TAKE-OFF"", which provides for the control of this action; - design features of the An-148 aircraft in terms of the restrictions on the duration of pitot tube heating operation on the ground, which led to the need to carry out operations to control the inclusion of pitot tube heating and compliance with the principle of ""dark cockpit"" in a separate section of the ""BEFORE THE FLIGHT"" check list, which is performed immediately before the start of the takeoff run, which creates additional risks of missing these operations. These actions are provided in the section ""ON THE RUNWAY START""; - systematic failure of the airline's crews to comply with the ""dark cockpit"" principle and the requirements of the radar, which contributed to ""getting used"" to the takeoff with the presence of emergency and warning messages on the Integrated system and alarm indicator (KISS) and did not allow to identify the fact that the pitot tube heating was not included. In the accident flight before takeoff, six warning messages were displayed on the KISS, including three messages about the absence of pitot tube heating; - design features of the An-148 aircraft, connected with the impossibility to disable the display of a number of warning messages on the KISS even when performing the whole range of works provided for by the MMEL while ensuring the flight with delayed defects; - low safety culture in the airline, which was manifested in: systematic failure to record in the flight log the failures detected during the flight, as well as in the performance of flights with the failures not eliminated and/or not included in the list of delayed failures, accompanied by the corresponding messages on the KISS; - Failure to take necessary measures in case of detection of previous facts of untimely activation of pitot tube heating by crews based on the results of express analysis of flight information; - Unreadiness of the crew to take actions in case of triggering the alarm ""Speed of Emergency"" due to the lack of appropriate theoretical training in the airline and the impossibility to work out this special situation on the flight simulation device and / or during airfield training and, as a consequence, failure to comply with the procedures provided for after triggering of this alarm; - Absence of federal aviation regulations for certification of flight simulators, the development of which is provided for by the Air Code of the Russian Federation; - Approval for the existing AN-148 flight simulators of the IFC Training LLC and the CTC of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation without taking into account their actual capabilities to reproduce special flight cases, as well as the provisions of FAR-128; - Absence of specific values of flight parameters (engine operation mode, pitch and roll angles, etc.) in the aircraft's flight ma"

The Avro climbed to a cruising altitude of FL270. At 21:40 the crew were cleared to descend to FL240 and two minutes later further down to FL160. At that time the crew were carrying out an approach briefing for a runway 14 ILS approach at Zürich. Having been further cleared down to FL130, the crew were told to prepare for a runway 28 VOR/DME approach. Another approach briefing was carried out and the minimum descent altitude was found to be 2390 feet AMSL. At 21:58 the aircraft was cleared for the runway 28 approach. At 22:03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 feet after which it turned right for the final approach to runway 28. At 22:04 a preceding aircraft reported having the runway in sight at 2.2DME. At about 22:05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and said that he could see the ground. A little later the radio altimeter reported 500 feet agl, followed by a ""minimum"" warning. The captain then ordered a go around, but this was too late. The aircraft struck trees and crashed. The treetops were at 1784 feet AMSL. On October 18, a treaty was signed between Switzerland and Germany a.o. regarding the use of German airspace for Zurich approaches at certain times of the day. After 10 p.m., incoming aircraft had to approach Zurich from the east to land on runway 28. While the other runways have ILS equipment, runway 28 only allows VOR/DME approaches. Over a two week period (9-22 November) 108 approaches were carried out on runway - 2,3% of the total number of landings for that period.  CAUSES: ""The accident is attributable to the fact that on the final approach, in own navigation, of the standard VOR/DME approach 28 the aircraft flew controlled into a wooded range of hills (controlled flight into terrain - CFIT), because the flight crew deliberately continued the descent under instrument flight conditions below the minimum altitude for the approach without having the necessary prerequisites. The flight crew initiated the go around too late. The investigation has determined the following causal factors in relation to the accident: - The commander deliberately descended below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of the standard VOR/DME approach 28 without having the required visual contact to the approach lights or the runway - The copilot made no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The following factors contributed to the accident: - In the approach sector of runway 28 at Zurich airport there was no system available which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated (minimum safe altitude warning - MSAW). - Over a long period of time, the responsible persons of the airline did not make correct assessments of the commanders flying performance. Where weaknesses were perceptable, they did not take appropriate measures. The commanders ability to concentrate and take appropriate decisions as well as his ability to analyse complex processes were adversely affected by fatigue. - Task-sharing between the flight crew during the approach was not appropriate and did not correspond to the required procedures by the airline. - The range of hills which the aircraft came into contact with was not marked on the approach chart used by the flight crew. - The means of determining the meteorological visibility at the airport was not representative for the approach sector runway 28, because it did not correspond to the actual visibility. - The valid visual minimums at the time of the accident were inappropriate for a decision to use the standard VOR/DME approach 28."""

	   Germany",Initial climb,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Airport (HAM/EDDH),Málaga Airport (AGP/LEMG),"A BAC One-Eleven 515FB passenger jet, operated by Paninternational, was destroyed in a forced landing on a road, shortly after takeoff from Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Airport (HAM), Germany. One crew member and 21 passengers were killed. Five crew members and 94 passengers survived the accident. Paninternational flight 112 was a charter flight from Hannover, Germany, to Málaga, Spain, with an intermediate stop at Hamburg.  While on the ground at Hamburg, five water canisters were offloaded from the cargo hold. The canisters contained demineralized water and were used to fill the water tank near the engines. For better engine performance during takeoff a water/methanol mixture can be injected into the fuel-air mixture. The mixture makes the air cooler and denser after passing the compressor, ahead of the combustion chamber. When the airplane was prepared for the flight to Málaga, taxi clearance was given to runway 34. Takeoff was commenced at 18:18. The captain opted for a takeoff with injection in view of the high temperature and the actual take-off weight. Reaching a speed of V1 during takeoff, the crew noted a rise in engine temperature. Takeoff was continued. The left-hand engine then failed, immediately followed by the right-hand engine. The airplane was climbing through an altitude of 300 m and the pilot pushed the nose down to gain speed. The engines could not be restarted, forcing the crew to carry out an emergency landing on the Hamburg-Kiel Autobahn E45.  Due to the high sink rate the jet touched down hard. The left hand main gear collapsed. The crew applied brakes to keep the airplane on the road. It then struck concrete pillars of an overpass, causing the flight deck to separate. The fuselage skidded and broke up, bursting into flames. The female first officer of the flight survived the accident. She later died in a Cessna Citation accident on May 31, 1987.  Investigation revealed that two of the five water canisters actually contained kerosene. The canisters had been misplaced at Düsseldorf the night before and loaded on board the plane.   Accident Causes The accident is attributable to the fact that at least one of the portable containers, from which the common onboard tank of the water injection system for both engines was filled, contained fuel instead of water.  The possibility of such a fueling error was facilitated by the fact that the transport containers used were not labeled regarding their contents and purpose, were improperly stored, and consequently improperly used.  As a result, during the initial climb phase of takeoff, fuel was supplied to the engines through the water injection system towards the end of the injection process instead of water, causing severe overheating of the engines, which led to significant damage, particularly to the turbines. These damages resulted in a substantial loss of thrust, making it impossible to continue the flight and forcing an immediate emergency landing.  Due to the low altitude, the highway presented the most favorable emergency landing site. The landing on the highway was very hard, causing the left main landing gear to break. Due to the damage to both engines, there were very limited options for the aircraft to land with a lower descent rate. Additionally, the aircraft's weight exceeded the permissible landing weight.  After the landing and the breaking of the left landing gear, the further course of events was beyond the crew's control."

The Boeing 707-300 was on a long approach to runway 20 when, near the runway threshold and at a height of 900 feet, power was increased and the gear retracted. The plane made three 360 degrees turns to the left and climbed to 1500 feet. During these turns the bank angle increased more and more until the aircraft was in a near vertical bank. The wings then leveled, followed by an abrupt pitch up. The 707 lost speed, started to spiral rapidly towards the ground nose down, crashed and caught fire.  Among the victims were all eighteen members of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team, as well as sixteen other people who were accompanying them. The ground casualty was a farmer who was struck by debris.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Having carried out all possible reasonable investigations, the Commission concluded that the cause of the accident had to be looked for in the material failure of the flying controls. However, while it was possible to advance certain hypotheses regarding the possible causes, they could not be considered entirely satisfactory. Only the material failure of two systems could lead to a complete explanation, but left the way open to an arbitrary choice because there was not sufficient evidence to corroborate it."" The FAA commented that the most plausible hypothesis was a malfunction of the stabilizer adjusting mechanism permitting the stabilizer to run to the 10.5deg nose-up position."

The flight crew had to maintain runway heading until reaching 5000 feet. The controller placed this restriction on Flight 22 to keep it on a southeasterly course until a Cessna 310, registration N3121S, had reported over the Asheville VOR. The Cessna, owned by Lanseair, was on a company business flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Asheville with three occupants on board.  While the Boeing 727 was still on its takeoff roll the pilot of the Cessna reported ""Two one Sierra just passed over the VOR, we're headed for the ... ... for .. ah .. Asheville now."" The Approach controller then cleared the Cessna to descend and maintain 6000 feet. At 11:59:44 the controller cleared Flight 22 to ""... climb unrestricted to the VOR, report passing the VOR"". He then cleared the Cessna for an ADF-2 approach to runway 16. The Boeing 727 was in a climbing left turn when both aircraft collided at an altitude of 6132 feet. Just before the collision the Cessna was observed to pull up sharply, with impact occurring between the nose of the Cessna and the left forward fuselage section of the Boeing 727. The jet continued straight ahead momentarily, then nosed over and fell rapidly to the ground. The Cessna disintegrated in flight and crashed.

Flight 514 departed Indianapolis at 08:53 EST and arrived in Columbus at 09:32. The Boeing 727 departed Columbus at 10:24, eleven minutes late. There were 85 passengers and 7 flight crew members aboard the aircraft when it departed Columbus.  At 10:36, the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) informed the crew of Flight 514 that no landings were being made at Washington National Airport because of high crosswinds, and that flights destined for that airport were either being held or being diverted to Dulles International Airport (IAD). At 10:38, the captain of Flight 514 communicated with the dispatcher in New York and advised him of the information he had received. The dispatcher, with the captain's concurrence, subsequently amended Flight 514's release to allow the flight to proceed to Dulles.  At 10:42, Cleveland ARTCC cleared Flight 514 to Dulles Airport via the Front Royal VOR, and to maintain FL290.  One minute later, the controller cleared the flight to descend to FL230 and to cross a point 40 miles west of Front Royal at that altitude. Control of the flight was then transferred to the Washington ARTCC and communications were established with that facility at 10:48. In the meantime, the flightcrew discussed the instrument approach to runway 12, the navigational aids, and the runways at Dulles, and the captain turned the flight controls over to the first officer. When radio communications were established with Washington ARTCC, the controller affirmed that he knew the flight was proceeding to Dulles. Following this contact, the crew discussed the various routings they might receive to conduct a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Dulles.  At 10:51, the Washington ARTCC controller requested the flight's heading. After being told that the flight was on a heading of 100 degrees, the controller cleared the crew to change to a heading of 090°, to intercept the 300° radial of the Armel VOR, to cross a point 25 miles northwest of Armel to maintain 8,000 feet, ""...and the 300° radial will be for  a VOR approach to runway 12 at Dulles."" He gave the crew an altimeter setting of 29.74 for Dulles. The crew acknowledged this clearance. The pilots again discussed the VOR/DME approach At 10:55, the landing preliminary checklist was read by the flight engineer and the other crewmembers responded to the calls. A reference speed of 127 kts was calculated and set on the airspeed indicator reference pointers. The altimeters were set at 29.74. The crew then again discussed items on the instrument approach chart including the Round Hill intersection, the final approach fix, the visual approach slope indicator and runway lights, and the airport diagram. At 10:59, the captain commented that the flight was descending from 11,000 feet to 8,000 feet. He then asked the controller if there were any weather obstructions between the flight and the airport. The controller replied that he did not see any significant weather along the route. The captain replied that the crew also did not see any weather on the aircraft weather radar.  At 11:01, the controller cleared the flight to descend to and maintain 7,000 feet and to contact Dulles approach control.  Twenty-six seconds later, the captain initiated a conversation with Dulles approach control and reported that the aircraft was descending from 10,000 feet to maintain 7,000 feet. He also reported having received the information ""Charlie"" transmitted on the ATIS broadcast. The controller replied with a clearance to proceed inbound to Armel and to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12. The controller then informed the crew that ATIS information Delta was current and read the data to them. The crew determined that the difference between information Charlie and Delta was the altimeter setting which was given in Delta as 29.70. There was no information on the CVR to indicate that the pilots reset their altimeters from 29.74. At 11:04, the flight reported it was level at 7,000 feet.  Five seconds after receiving that report, the controller said, ""TWA 514, you're cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 12."" This clearance was acknowledged by the captain. The CVR recorded the sound of the landing gear warning horn followed by a comment from the captain that ""Eighteen hundred is the bottom."" The first officer then said, ""Start down."" The flight engineer said, ""We're out here quite a ways. I better turn the heat down."" At 11:05:06, the captain reviewed the field elevation, the minimum descent altitude, and the final approach fix and discussed the reason that no time to the missed approach point was published. At 11:06:15, the first officer commented that, ""I hate the altitude jumping around. Then he commented that the instrument panel was bouncing around. At 11:06:15, the captain said, ""We have a discrepancy in our VOR's, a little but not much."" He continued, ""Fly yours, not mine."" At 11:06:27, the captain discussed the last reported ceiling and minimum descent altitude. concluded, ""...should break out.""  At 11:06:42, the first officer said, ""Gives you a headache after a while, watching this jumping around like that."" At 11:07:27, he said, ""...you can feel that wind down here now."" A few seconds later, the captain said, ""You know, according to this dumb sheet it says thirtyfour hundred to Round Hill --- is our minimum altitude."" The flight engineer then asked where the captain saw that and the captain replied, ""Well, here. Round Hill is eleven and a half DME."" The first officer said, ""Well, but ---"" and the captain replied, ""When he clears you, that means you can go to your ---"" An unidentified voice said, ""Initial approach, and another unidentified voice said, ""Yeah!"" Then the captain said ""Initial approach altitude."" The flight engineer then said, ""We're out a --- twenty-eight for eighteen."" An unidentified voice said, ""Right, and someone said, ""One to go."" At 11:08:14, the flight engineer said, ""Dark in here,"" and the first officer stated, ""And bumpy too."" At 11:08:25, the sound of an altitude alert horn was recorded. The captain said, ""I had ground contact a minute ago,"" and the first officer replied, ""Yeah, I did too."" At 11:08:29, the first officer said, ""...power on this.... "" The captain said ""Yeah --- you got a high sink rate."" ""Yeah,"" the first officer replied. An unidentified voice said, ""We're going uphill, "" and the flight engineer replied, ""We're right there, we're on course."" Two voices responded, ""Yeah!"" The captain then said, ""You ought to see ground outside in just a minute -- Hang in there boy."" The flight engineer said, ""We're getting seasick.""  At 1108:57, the altitude alert sounded. Then the first officer said, ""Boy, it was --- wanted to go right down through there, man,"" to which an unidentified voice replied, ""Yeah!"" Then the first officer said, ""Must have had a # of a downdraft.""  At 1109:14, the radio altimeter warning horn sounded and stopped. The first officer said, ""Boy!"" At 11:09:20, the captain said, ""Get some power on."" The radio altimeter warning horn sounded again and stopped. At 11:09:22, the sound of impact was recorded.  After the aircraft left 7,000 feet, the descent was continuous with little rate variation until the indicated altitude was about 1,750 feet. increased about 150 feet over a 15-second period and then decreased about 200 feet during a 20-second period. The recorded altitude remained about 1,750 feet until the airplane impacted the west slope of Mount Weather, Virginia, about 25 nmi from Dulles, at an elevation of about 1,670 feet (509 m).  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The crew's decision to descend to 1800ft before the aircraft had reached the approach segment where that minimum altitude applied. The crew's decision to descend was a result of inadequacies and lack of clarity in the air traffic control procedures which led to a misunderstanding on the part of the pilots and of the controllers regarding each other's responsibilities during operations in terminal areas under instrument meteorological conditions. Nevertheless, the examination of the plan view of the approach chart should have disclosed to the captain that a minimum altitude of 1800ft was not a safe altitude. Contributing factors were: 1) The  failure of the FAA to take timely action to resolve the confusion and misinterpretation of air traffic terminology although the Agency had been aware of the problem for several years; 2) The issuance of the approach clearance when the flight was 44 miles from the airport on an unpublished route without clearly defined minimum altitudes; and 3) Inadequate depiction of altitude restrictions on the profile view of the approach chart for the VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Dulles Int. Airport."""
Monday 29 October 2018,06:30,Boeing 737 MAX 8,Lion Air,895,189,"15 km N off Tanjung Bungin - 
	   Indonesia",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII),Pangkal Pinang Airport (PGK/WIKK),"Lion Air flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Indonesia, killing all 189 on board. The aircraft, registration PK-LQP, had entered service with Lion Air on August 18, 2018. The Aircraft Flight Maintenance Log (AFML) recorded that since October 26, 2018 until the occurrence date several problems occurred related to airspeed and altitude flags that appeared on the captain's (left) Primary Flight Display (PFD) on three occasions, SPEED TRIM FAIL light illumination and MACH TRIM FAIL light illumination that occurred twice. Several attempts were made by engineers to rectify these issues. The day before the accident the Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor was replaced by engineers at Denpasar Airport. The flight from Denpasar to Jakarta (JT43) was the flight prior to JT610. During rotation of flight JT43, the stick shaker activated and an IAS DISAGREE warning showed on the captain's PFD at 400 feet. The flight was handled by the copilot as it was determined that the captain's PFD was unreliable. The flight crew moved the STAB TRIM (stabilizer trim) switch to CUT OUT due to three automatic nosedown trim occurrences. The crew worked checklists and continued the flight to CGK. Based on the crew's entry in the AFML, the engineer at Jakarta flushed the left Pitot Air Data Module (ADM) and static ADM to rectify the reported IAS and ALT disagree and cleaned the electrical connector plug of the elevator feel computer. The aircraft was subsequently released to carry out flight JT610. During takeoff from Jakarta, the DFDR recorded a difference between left and right Angle of Attack of about 20° which continued until the end of the recording. During rotation of the aircraft, the left control column stick shaker activated and continued for most of the flight. After the flaps were retracted, the FDR recorded automatic aircraft nose down (AND) trim for 10 seconds followed by flight crew commanded aircraft nose up (ANU) trim. Automatic AND trim briefly stopped when the flaps were temporarily extended to 5. In their communications with air traffic control, the flight crew asked the controller to confirm the altitude of the aircraft and later also asked the speed as shown on the controller radar display. The copilot reported experiencing a ""flight control problem"" and that they were flying the aircraft manually. Last radio contact was at 06:31 local time when the captain requested the arrival controller to block altitude 3,000 feet above and below for traffic avoidance. The controller asked what altitude the pilot wanted, to which the captain responded ""five thou"". The controller approved the pilot request. The FDR stopped recording within twenty seconds of the pilot's response. The aircraft impacted the sea some 15 km north off Tanjung Bungin. All 189 persons on board died in the accident.  Search and rescue personnel recovered the flight data recorder (FDR) and other debris on November 1, at 30-35 m below the water surface.   In the initial stages of the investigation, it was found that there is a potential for repeated automatic nose-down trim commands of the horizontal stabilizer when the flight control system on a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft receives an erroneously high single AOA sensor input. Such a specific condition could among others potentially result in the stick shaker activating on the affected side and IAS, ALT and/or AOA DISAGREE alerts. The logic behind the automatic nosedown trim lies in the aircraft's MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that was introduced by Boeing on the MAX series aircraft. This feature was added to prevent the aircraft from entering a stall under specific conditions. On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor.  On November 7, the FAA issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring ""revising certificate limitations and operating procedures of the airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures to follow under certain conditions.""  Contributing Factors: 1. During the design and certification of the Boeing 737-8 (MAX), assumptions were made about flight crew response to malfunctions which, even though consistent with current industry guidelines, turned out to be incorrect. 2. Based on the incorrect assumptions about flight crew response and an incomplete review of associated multiple flight deck effects, MCASs reliance on a single sensor was deemed appropriate and met all certification requirements. 3. MCAS was designed to rely on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from that sensor. 4. The absence of guidance on MCAS or more detailed use of trim in the flight manuals and in flight crew training, made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS. 5. The AOA DISAGREE alert was not correctly enabled during Boeing 737-8 (MAX) development. As a result, it did not appear during flight with the mis-calibrated AOA sensor, could not be documented by the flight crew and was therefore not available to help maintenance identify the mis-calibrated AOA sensor. 6. The replacement AOA sensor that was installed on the accident aircraft had been mis-calibrated during an earlier repair. This mis-calibration was not detected during the repair. 7. The investigation could not determine that the installation test of the AOA sensor was performed properly. The mis-calibration was not detected. 8. Lack of documentation in the aircraft flight and maintenance log about the continuous stick shaker and use of the Runaway Stabilizer NNC meant that information was not available to the maintenance crew in Jakarta nor was it available to the accident crew, making it more difficult for each to take the appropriate actions. 9. The multiple alerts, repetitive MCAS activations, and distractions related to numerous ATC communications were not able to be effectively managed. This was caused by the difficulty of the situation and performance in manual handling, NNC execution, and flight crew communication, leading to ineffective CRM application and workload management. These performances had previously been identified during training and reappeared during the accident flight."

Holding on the taxiway at BWI for 1.5 hours required the flight to return to the terminal area for fuel. The Boeing 737-400 left BWI uneventfully and arrived at LGA's Gate 15 at 20:40. Weather and air traffic in the LGA terminal area had caused cancellations and delayed most flights for several hours. The USAir dispatcher decided to cancel the Norfolk leg of Flight 1846, unload the passengers, and send the flight to Charlotte (CLT) without passengers. Several minutes later, the dispatcher told the captain that his airplane would not be flown empty but would carry passengers to Charlotte as USAir flight 5050. This seemed to upset the captain. He expressed concern for the passengers because more delays would cause him and the first officer to exceed crew duty time limitations before the end of the trip. While passengers were boarding, the captain visited USAir's ground movement control tower to ask about how decisions were made about flights and passengers. The captain returned to the cockpit as the last of the passengers were boarding, and the entry door was closed. After the jetway was retracted, the passenger service representative told the captain through the open cockpit window that he wanted to open the door again to board more passengers. The captain refused, and flight 5050 left Gate 15 at 22:52. The 737 taxied out to runway 31. Two minutes after push-back, the ground controller told the crew to hold short of taxiway Golf Golf. However, the captain failed to hold short of that taxiway and received modified taxi instructions from the ground controller at 22:56. The captain then briefed takeoff speeds as V1: 125 knots, VR: 128 knots, and V2: 139 knots. The first officer was to be the flying pilot. He was conducting his first nonsupervised line takeoff in a Boeing 737. About 2 minutes later, the first officer announced ""stabilizer and trim"" as part of the before-takeoff checklist. The captain responded with ""set"" and then corrected himself by saying: ""Stabilizer trim, I forgot the answer. Set for takeoff.""  Flight 5050 was cleared into position to hold at the end of the runway at 23:18:26 and received takeoff clearance at 23:20:05. The first officer pressed the autothrottle disengage and then pressed the TO/GA button, but noted no throttle movement. He then advanced the throttles manually to a ""rough"" takeoff-power setting. The captain then said: ""Okay, that's the wrong button pushed"" and 9 seconds later said: ""All right, I'll set your power."" During the takeoff roll the airplane began tracking to the left. The captain initially used the nosewheel steering tiller to maintain directional control. About 18 seconds after beginning the roll a ""bang"" was heard followed shortly by a loud rumble, which was due to the cocked nosewheel as a result of using the nosewheel steering during the takeoff roll. At 23:20:53, the captain said ""got the steering."" The captain later testified that he had said, ""You've got the steering."" The first officer testified that he thought the captain had said: ""I've got the steering."" When the first officer heard the captain, he said ""Watch it then"" and began releasing force on the right rudder pedal but kept his hands on the yoke in anticipation of the V1 and rotation callouts. At 23:20:58.1, the captain said: ""Let's take it back then"" which he later testified meant that he was aborting the takeoff. According to the captain, he rejected the takeoff because of the continuing left drift and the rumbling noise. He used differential braking and nose wheel steering to return toward the centerline and stop. The throttle levers were brought back to their idle stops at 23:20:58.4. The indicated airspeed at that time was 130 knots. Increasing engine sound indicating employment of reverse thrust was heard on the CVR almost 9 seconds after the abort maneuver began. The airplane did not stop on the runway but crossed the end of the runway at 34 knots ground speed. The aircraft dropped onto the wooden approach light pier, which collapsed causing the aircraft break in three and drop into 7-12 m deep East River. The accident was not survivable for the occupants of seats 21A and 21B because of the massive upward crush of the cabin floor.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to exercise his command authority in a timely manner to reject the take-off or take sufficient control to continue the take-off, which was initiated with a mistrimmed rudder. Also causal was the captain's failure to detect the mistrimmed rudder before the take-off was attempted."" Board member Jim Burnett filed the following concurring and dissenting statement: ""Although I concur with the probable cause as adopted as far as it goes, I would have added the following as a contributing factor: Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of USAir to provide an adequately experienced and seasoned flight crew."""

All 56 passengers and 6 crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-500 registered PK-CLC, arrived at Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 12:11 hours local time after a flight from Pangkal Pinang. The subsequent flight for the aircraft, SJ182, was due to depart at 13:40. Weather at the airport was poor with heavy rainfall and low clouds due to a thunderstorm in de vicinity. This caused a delay in departure. At 14:18 the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 25R. Take-off from runway 32R was commenced at 14:35 (07:35 UTC).  At 14:36:46, the pilot contacted the Terminal East (TE) controller and was cleared for an unrestricted climb to FL290. Five seconds later, at altitude of 1,980 feet, the Autopilot (AP) system engaged. At 14:38:42, as the aircraft climbed past 8150 feet, the thrust lever of the left engine started reducing, while the thrust lever of the right engine remained in position. FDR data showed that the left engine N1 was decreasing whereas the right engine N1 remained the same. Nine seconds later flight requested a heading change to 075° to avoid weather conditions, which was approved by the TE controller. At 14:40:05, the aircraft reached the highest altitude of about 10,900 feet. The autopilot system disengaged at that point with a heading of 016°, the pitch angle was about 4.5° nose up, and the aircraft rolled to the left to more than 45°. The thrust lever position of the left engine continued decreasing while the right engine thrust lever remained in position. Five seconds later the the autothrottle (A/T) system disengaged and the pitch angle was more than 10° nose down. The aircraft had entered a high speed descent and impacted the surface of the sea about 20 seconds later. The wreckage was located and appeared to be distributed across an area of about 80 by 110 meters on the seabed at a depth of approximately 16 meters.  The Indonesian NTSC reported on February 10 that the aircraft had a repeating issue the autothrottle in the days before the accident.  On 3 January 2021, a pilot reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle computers electrical connector. After re-installation, the Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) test result was good.  On 4 January 2021, a pilot again reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer tried cleaning the autothrottle computers electrical connector but the problem remained and it was transferred to the Deferred Maintenance Items. On 5 January 2021, an engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle Takeoff and Go Around (TOGA) switch and conducted a BITE test on the autothrottle computer. The BITE test result was good.  Contributing Factors: - The corrective maintenance processes of the A/T problem were unable to identify the friction or binding within the mechanical system of the thrust lever and resulted in the prolonged and unresolved of the A/T problem. - The right thrust lever did not reduce when required by the A/P to obtain selected rate of climb and aircraft speed due to the friction or binding within the mechanical system, as a result, the left thrust lever compensated by moving further backward which resulted in thrust asymmetry. - The delayed CTSM activation to disengage the A/T system during the thrust asymmetry event due to the undervalued spoiler angle position input resulted in greater power asymmetry. - The automation complacency and confirmation bias might have led to a decrease in active monitoring which resulted in the thrust lever asymmetry and deviation of the flight path were not being monitored. - The aircraft rolled to the left instead of to the right as intended while the control wheel deflected to the right and inadequate monitoring of the EADI might have created assumption that the aircraft was rolling excessively to the right which resulted in an action that was contrary in restoring the aircraft to safe flight parameters. - The absence of the guidance of the national standard for the UPRT, may have contributed to the training program not being adequately implemented to ensure that pilots have enough knowledge to prevent and recover of an upset condition effectively and timely."

	   United States of America",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA)","Dallas-Love Field, TX (DAL/KDAL)","Southwest Airlines flight 1380 diverted to Philadelphia Airport, Pennsylvania, USA, after suffering an in-flight uncontained engine failure. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, originated from New York-La Guardia Airport at 10:43 for a flight to Dallas-Love Field, Texas. About 11:04, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport. As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing. The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 11:19 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway. ARFF services attended to the no.1 engine while injured passenger who was seated near the lost window was rushed to hospital. The passenger is reported to have died. Preliminary findings of the NTSB show that the no.13 fan blade of engine no.1 was missing. It appears to have broken away at the hub. There is evidence of metal fatigue in the area where the blade broke. Also, a part of the no.1 engine cowling was reported to have been found at Burnville, PA.  Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of this accident was a low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality."
Monday 25 January 2010,02:41,Boeing 737-8AS (WL),Ethiopian Airlines,26459,90,"11 km SW off Beirut International Airport (BEY) - 
	   Lebanon",Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Beirut International Airport (BEY/OLBA),Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD/HAAB),"A Boeing 737-8AS(WL) passenger jet, registered ET-ANB, was destroyed in an accident 6 km southwest off Beirut International Airport (BEY), Lebanon. All 82 passengers and eight crew members were killed. The airplane operated on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET409 from Beirut International Airport (BEY) to Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD). Instruments meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. It was night in dark lighting conditions with reported isolated cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms in the area. Flight ET409 was initially cleared by ATC on a LATEB 1 D Standard Instrument Departure (SID) from runway 21. Just before takeoff, ATC changed the clearance to an ""immediate right turn direct Chekka"". The Boeing 737 took off from runway 21 at 02:36. After takeoff ATC instructed ET409 to turn right on a heading of 315° and change frequencies and contact Beirut Control. ET409 acknowledged the clearance and continued a right turn. ATC instructed ET409 to turn left heading 270°, which was acknowledged. The flight continued the climbing left turn to heading 270° but did not maintain that heading. The aircraft continued on a southerly track. Just prior to reaching altitude of 7700 feet, the stick shaker activated, sounding for a period of 29 seconds. Meanwhile the airplane reached an angle of attack (AOA) of 32° and began a descent to 6000 feet. When the stick shaker ceased, the aircraft began to climb again. At 02:40:56, just prior to reaching 9000 feet, the stick shaker activated again, sounding for a period of 26 seconds.  After reaching 9000 feet the aircraft made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly. The maximum registered bank angle was 118° left and the airplane reached a maximum registered speed was 407.5 knots at a G load of 4.412. The airplane disappeared from the radar screen and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea at 02:41:30.  PROBABLE CAUSES: 1- The flight crew's mismanagement of the aircraft's speed, altitude, headings and attitude through inconsistent flight control inputs resulting in a loss of control. 2- The flight crew failure to abide by CRM principles of mutual support and calling deviations hindered any timely intervention and correction. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1- The manipulation of the flight controls by the flight crew in an ineffective manner resulted in the aircraft undesired behavior and increased the level of stress of the pilots. 2- The aircraft being out of trim for most of the flight directly increased the workload on the pilot and made his control of the aircraft more demanding. 3- The prevailing weather conditions at night most probably resulted in spatial disorientation to the flight crew and lead to loss of situational awareness. 4- The relative inexperience of the Flight Crew on type combined with their unfamiliarity with the airport contributed, most likely, to increase the Flight Crew workload and stress. 5- The consecutive flying (188 hours in 51 days) on a new type with the absolute minimum rest could have likely resulted in a chronic fatigue affecting the captain's performance. 6- The heavy meal discussed by the crew prior to take-off has affected their quality of sleep prior to that flight. 7- The aircraft 11 bank angle aural warnings, 2 stalls and final spiral dive contributed in the increase of the crew workload and stress level. 8- Symptoms similar to those of a subtle incapacitation have been identified and could have resulted from and/or explain most of the causes mentioned above. However, there is no factual evidence to confirm without any doubt such a cause. 9- The F/O reluctance to intervene did not help in confirming a case of captain's subtle incapacitation and/or to take over control of the aircraft as stipulated in the operator's SOP."
Sunday 9 May 1976,14:35,Boeing 747-131F,Imperial Iranian Air Force - IIAF,,17,"near Madrid - 
	   Spain",En route,Military,Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII),Madrid-Torrejón AFB (TOJ/LETO),"The Boeing was operated on a military logistic flight from Tehran to McGuire AFB via Madrid. The flight took off from Tehran at 08:20 GMT and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL330. After establishing contact with Madrid control, clearance was received to CPL VOR via Castejon. At 14:25 the flight was cleared to FL100. At 14:30 the crew advised Madrid that they were diverting to the left because of thunderstorm activity, and at 14:32 Madrid cleared ULF48 to 5000 feet and directed him to contact Madrid approach control. At 14:33 the crew contacted approach control and advised them that there was too much weather activity ahead and requested to be vectored around it. Last radio contact was when ULF48 acknowledged the 260deg heading instructions and informed Madrid that they were descending to 5000 feet. The aircraft was later found to have crashed in farmland at 3000 feet msl following left wing separation. It appeared that the aircraft had been struck by lightning, entering a forward part of the aircraft and exiting from a static discharger on the left wingtip. The lightning current's conductive path to the static discharger at the tip was through a bond strap along the trailing edge. Concentration of current at the riveted joint between this bond strap and a wing rib were sufficient conductive to cause the flash to reattach to this rivet and to leave the discharger. Fuel vapors in the no. 1 fuel tank then ignited. The explosion caused the upper wing skin panel to separate, causing a drastic altering of the aero elastic properties of the wing, and especially the outboard section of wing. The outer wing began to oscillate, developing loads which caused the high-frequency antenna and outer tip to separate. The whole wing failed a little later."

The flight diverted to Mashhad, Iran were 25 passengers were released. The hijackers demanded the release of 17 Shiite Muslims guerrillas held in Kuwait. One day into the hijacking, on April 6, 32 more hostages were released. But three days later the hijackers forced the Iranian authorities to refuel the jet and flew to Larnaca, Cyprus. During a four day stopover in Larnaca they released one passenger but killed two others to force the authorities to give them more fuel. On 13 April the hijackers flew to Algeria where a week later they finally freed their remaining 32 hostages and surrendered.  The duration of the hijacking was 16 days."
Wednesday 6 August 1997,01:42,Boeing 747-3B5,Korean Air,50105,228,"4,8 km SW of Guam-Agana International Airport (GUM) - 
	   Guam",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Seoul-Gimpo (Kimpo) International Airport (SEL/RKSS),Guam-A.B. Won Pat International Airport (GUM/PGUM),"Korean Air Flight 801 was a regular flight from Seoul to Guam. The Boeing 747-300 departed the gate about 21:27 and was airborne about 21:53. The captain was pilot-flying. Upon arrival to the Guam area, the first officer made initial contact with the Guam Combined Center/Radar Approach Control (CERAP) controller about 01:03, when the airplane was level at 41,000 feet and about 240 nm northwest of the NIMITZ VOR/DME. The CERAP controller told flight 801 to expect to land on runway 06L. About 01:10, the controller instructed flight 801 to ""...descend at your discretion maintain two thousand six hundred."" The first officer responded, ""...descend two thousand six hundred pilot discretion."" The captain then began briefing the first officer and the flight engineer about the approach and landing at Guam: ""I will give you a short briefing...ILS is one one zero three...NIMITZ VOR is one one five three, the course zero six three, since the visibility is six, when we are in the visual approach, as I said before, set the VOR on number two and maintain the VOR for the TOD [top of descent], I will add three miles from the VOR, and start descent when we're about one hundred fifty five miles out. I will add some more speed above the target speed. Well, everything else is all right. In case of go-around, since it is VFR, while staying visual and turning to the right...request a radar vector...if not, we have to go to FLAKE...since the localizer glideslope is out, MDA is five hundred sixty feet and HAT [height above touchdown] is three hundred four feet...."" About 01:13 the captain said, ""we better start descent;"" shortly thereafter, the first officer advised the controller that flight 801 was ""leaving four one zero for two thousand six hundred."" During the descent it appeared that the weather at Guam was worsening. At 01:24 requested a deviation 10 miles to the left to avoid severe weather. At 01:31 the first officer reported to the CERAP controller that the airplane was clear of cumulonimbus clouds and requested ""radar vectors for runway six left."" The controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 120°. After this transmission, the flight crew performed the approach checklist and verified the radio frequency for the ILS to runway 06L. About 01:38 the CERAP controller instructed flight 801 to ""...turn left heading zero nine zero join localizer;"" the first officer acknowledged this transmission. At that time, flight 801 was descending through 2,800 feet msl with the flaps extended 10° and the landing gear up. One minute later the controller stated, ""Korean Air eight zero one cleared for ILS runway six left approach...glideslope unusable."" The first officer responded, ""Korean eight zero one roger...cleared ILS runway six left;"" his response did not acknowledge that the glideslope was unusable. The flight engineer asked, ""is the glideslope working? glideslope? yeh?"" One second later, the captain responded, ""yes, yes, it's working."" About 01:40, an unidentified voice in the cockpit stated, ""check the glideslope if working?"" This statement was followed 1 second later by an unidentified voice in the cockpit asking, ""why is it working?"" The first officer responded, ""not useable."" The altitude alert system chime sounded and the airplane began to descend from an altitude of 2,640 feet msl at a point approximately 9 nm from the runway 06L threshold. About 01:40:22, an unidentified voice in the cockpit said, ""glideslope is incorrect."" As the airplane was descending through 2,400 feet msl, the first officer stated, ""approaching fourteen hundred."" About 4 seconds later, when the airplane was about 8 nm from the runway 06L threshold, the captain stated, ""since today's glideslope condition is not good, we need to maintain one thousand four hundred forty. please set it."" An unidentified voice in the cockpit then responded, ""yes."" About 01:40:42, the CERAP controller instructed flight 801 to contact the Agana control tower. The first officer contacted the Agana tower: ""Korean air eight zero one intercept the localizer six left."" The airplane was descending below 2,000 feet msl at a point 6.8 nm from the runway threshold (3.5 nm from the VOR). About 01:41:01, the Agana tower controller cleared flight 801 to land. About 01:41:14, as the airplane was descending through 1,800 feet msl, the first officer acknowledged the landing clearance, and the captain requested 30° of flaps. The first officer called for the landing checklist and at 01:41:33, the captain said, ""look carefully"" and ""set five hundred sixty feet"" (the published MDA). The first officer replied ""set,"" the captain called for the landing checklist, and the flight engineer began reading the landing checklist. About 01:41:42, as the airplane descended through 1,400 feet msl, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded with the radio altitude callout ""one thousand [feet]."" One second later, the captain stated, ""no flags gear and flaps,"" to which the flight engineer responded, ""no flags gear and flaps."" About 01:41:46, the captain asked, ""isn't glideslope working?"" The captain then stated, ""wiper on."" About 01:41:53, the first officer again called for the landing checklist, and the flight engineer resumed reading the checklist items. About 01:41:59, when the airplane was descending through 1,100 feet msl at a point about 4.6 nm from the runway 06L threshold (approximately 1.3 nm from the VOR), the first officer stated ""not in sight?"" One second later, the GPWS radio altitude callout sounded: ""five hundred [feet]."" About 01:42:14, as the airplane was descending through 840 feet msl and the flight crew was performing the landing checklist, the GPWS issued a ""minimums minimums"" annunciation followed by a ""sink rate"" alert about 3 seconds later. The first officer responded, ""sink rate okay"". At that time the airplane was descending 1,400 feet per minute. About 01:42:19, as the airplane descended through 730 feet msl, the flight engineer stated, ""two hundred [feet],"" and the first officer said, ""let's make a missed approach."" About one second later, the flight engineer stated, ""not in sight,"" and the first officer said, ""not in sight, missed approach."" About 01:42:22, as the airplane descended through approximately 680 feet msl, the nose began to pitch up and the flight engineer stated, ""go around."" When the captain stated ""go around"" power was added and airspeed began to increase. As the airplane descended through 670 feet msl, the autopilot disconnect warning sounded. The GPWS radio altitude callouts continued: ""one hundred...fifty...forty...thirty...twenty [feet]."" About 01:42:26, the airplane impacted hilly terrain at Nimitz Hill, Guam, about 660 feet msl and about 3.3 nm from the runway 06L -threshold. It struck trees and slid through dense vegetation before coming to rest. A post-impact fire broke out. It was established a.o. that the software fix for the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system at Agana Center Radar Approach Control (CERAP) had rendered the program useless. A software patch had been installed since there had been complaints of the high rate of false MSAW alarms at Guam. This made KAL801's descent below MDA go undetected at the Agana CERAP.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to adequately brief and execute the nonprecision approach and the first officer's and flight engineer's failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain's execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain's fatigue and Korean Air's inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's intentional inhibition of the minimum safe altitude warning system and the agency's failure to adequately to manage the system."""
Friday 23 July 1999,12:16,Boeing 747-481D,All Nippon Airways - ANA,,1,"near Tokyo - 
	   Japan",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT),Sapporo-Chitose Airport (CTS/RJCC),"A male Japanese passenger produced an 8-inch knife, forced his way into the flight deck, and ordered out the First Officer. The hijacker ordered the pilot to fly the plane to the American air base at Yokota. During the flight, the hijacker asked to fly the plane. When his request was refused, the man stabbed the pilot multiple times in the neck and shoulder, severely injuring him, and the plane went into a steep dive. Upon hearing the pilots screams, the copilot and others entered the cockpit, subdued the hijacker, and stopped the planes descent. The copilot flew the plane back to Haneda Airport and landed less than 90 minutes after having taken off. Although the plane landed safely, the pilot bled to death from his wounds en route. The hijacker was taken into custody. It is believed that the man hijacked the plane because, in his perception, Haneda Airport officials had failed to heed his warnings about security problems. He had claimed that these problems made Japanese airliners easy prey for hijackers. The hijacker also reportedly told investigators that he hijacked the plane because he wanted to fly a jumbo jet. He boasted of his piloting ability in flight simulation games."
Sunday 28 January 1996,17:05,Boeing 757-2T7,Britannia Airways,,1,"Near Málaga–Costa del Sol Airport, Churriana, Málaga - 
	   Spain",Approach,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Luton Airport (LTN/EGGP),"Málaga Airport (AGP/LEMG),","Whilst conducting a flight from Luton to Malaga, with the first officer as the handling pilot, the aircraft commander collapsed and died during the descent from cruising level shortly before the approach to Malaga Airport. A heart attack (cardiac arrest) was suspected as the cause. The first officer was able to make a safe landing. According to the following extract from the official AAIB report into the accident:   ""The flight, which was otherwise uneventful, took off on schedule at 14:40 hours, with the first officer as the handling pilot. It was planned to land at Malaga at 17:15 hours. From its cruising level of FL370, the flight was initially cleared to descend to FL330 at 16:26 hours. Then, at about 16:45 hours it was re-cleared to FL70. At about 17:05 hours, as the aircraft was descending through about FL150, the crew was given a radar heading of 180 degrees to position for a direct intercept of the ILS for Runway 14 at Malaga.   At this time, although nothing had been said, the first officer noticed that the commander appeared to be struggling for breath and so he pressed the cabin crew call button twice to summon assistance.   The No 1 cabin attendant heard the double chime and picked up the interphone to hear the first officer ask for assistance.She went into the flight deck and, seeing the commander slumped and apparently unconscious, pulled him upright and locked his harness. She then slid his seat back, reclined it and removed his feet from the rudder pedals. She also loosened his collar and tie and, having selected 100% oxygen, placed his crew oxygen mask on him.  The No 2 cabin attendant, who had also listened to the interphone,came onto the flight deck with a 'therapeutic' oxygen set and then returned to the cabin to make a PA asking for any doctor or medically qualified person to make themselves known. The No.1 attendant, believing that she heard the commander making small noises, felt for a pulse in his neck, but she was unable to detect any pulse. The No 2 attendant then escorted a nurse onto the flight deck but she was equally unsure whether there was a very faint pulse or none at all. Having tried unsuccessfully to strap the nurse into the jump seat, the attendants tried to fold down the left observer's seat but this was not possible because of the commander's rearward seat position.   As the landing was bythen imminent, the No 2 attendant returned to the cabin and took charge. The nurse returned to her seat, with the intention to return immediately after landing, and the No 1 attendant stayed with the commander.  When, as instructed, the first officer changed radio frequency to Malaga radar, he informed them that there was a medical emergency on board and that medical assistance would be needed on landing. He stated his intention to stop the aircraft on the runway as there was no steering tiller for the right hand seat and aircraft steps would be required to attend to the casualty. After repeating his request, he added that it was the commander who was incapacitated.   He was then re-cleared to 5,500 feet and a little later, he asked whether he was cleared for the ILS. He was instructed to turn left onto 165 degrees for the intercept. Just as the aircraft levelled at 5,500 feet the terrain closure rate warning of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded. This quickly turned into the 'hard'warning ""PULL UP, PULL UP"". The GPWS appears to have been triggered by the aircraft's flight path over a 4,000 foot ridge to the north-east of the airfield; the radio altimeter indications did not decrease below 1500 feet at this stage. The first officer immediately disconnected the autopilot, applied power and climbed to about 6,000 feet, where the aircraft broke cloud and he levelled off. The flight director captured the localiser at about 12 nm DME, some 2,000 feet above the glideslope and, as the first officer could then see the ground and the airfield, he initiated a fairly steep descent, using FLAP 5 degrees,spoilers and landing gear. He retracted the spoilers and extended flap progressively as the aircraft settled on the glideslope and he made a normal landing.   With the rudder pedal steering, hewas able to turn onto a high-speed turn-off, where he brought the aircraft to a standstill, started the APU and shut down the engines.  When the cabin crew disarmed and opened the doors, a paramedic was waiting but, as the steps had not arrived, he was unable to board the aircraft. The steps arrived two or three minutes later and the paramedic boarded and went onto the flight deck, where the Nos 1 and 2 attendants, together with the  nurse, were taking turns to apply Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). The nurse then went aft and the paramedic gave the commander an adrenaline injection. The first officer then told the cabin crew to close the doors and the aircraft was towed to the parking area whilst the crew continued with CPR.    An ambulance arrived and a stretcher was brought to take the commander, accompanied by the No 1 attendant,to the local hospital, where he was taken to the intensive care unit. A few minutes later, it was announced that he had died""  A contemporary press report (see link #3) named the pilot as Captain Roger Attenborough, aged 54, of Kempston near Bedford."
Saturday 23 November 1996,15:15,Boeing 767-260ER,Ethiopian Airlines,32353,125,"0,5 km N off Mitsamiouli, Grande Comore - 
	   Comoros",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD/HAAB),Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK),"Ethiopian Airlines flight ET961 had taken off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at 08:09 hours UTC for a scheduled flight to Abidjan, Ivory Coast via Nairobi, Kenya; Brazzaville, Congo; and Lagos, Nigeria.  Twenty minutes after takeoff, at about 08:29 UTC, one passenger stood up from his seat and ran up the aisle to the cockpit, and two other passengers followed him heading for the cockpit. While rushing to the cockpit one of the men said ""Everybody should be seated, I have a bomb!"". Then they opened the cockpit door and stormed in. They declared to the pilots that there were eleven hijackers on board and beat the First Officer and forced him out of the cockpit. They then grabbed the fire axe and fire extinguisher bottle from their respective stowages and ordered the pilot-in-command to change direction and fly to Australia. The pilot-in-command explained to the hijackers that he had not enough fuel to reach Australia and demanded to make a refueling stop at Mombasa. The hijackers refused the refueling stop and continued arguing with the pilot-in-command. They insisted that they had learned from the inflight magazine that the B767 could fly 11 hours without refueling.  After passing Dar es Salaam one of the hijackers ordered him to fly away from the coast, head to Australia and indicating to the altimeter not to descend below FL390. The pilot-in-command turned left towards the Comoros Island. The lead hijacker was sitting in the first officer's seat and was fiddling with the aircraft's controls, kicking the rudder, whilst also drinking whisky. The pilot-in-command kept on telling them that he was running short of fuel pointing to the fuel quantity indicators, but the hijackers did not listen. The leader continued fiddling with the controls, trying to turn the aileron and pulling the reverse thrust lever at random. As the flight came over the Comoros Islands the pilot-in-command saw the Moroni International Airport runway and circled 15-20 nm south of the field. Then the LOW FUEL CAUTION came on. The pilot-in-command pleaded to land because of low fuel. The hijackers were unconcerned and only insisted that the pilot not descend below FL390. At about 11:41 UTC the right engine ran down to wind milling speed. The pilot-in-command showed the red warning message for the right engine on the EICAS to the hijacker. At this moment, the hijacker left the right seat and went to the cabin door to discuss with the other two hijackers. This gave the captain the opportunity to pick up his microphone and address the passengers: ""....ladies and gentlemen this is your pilot, we have run out of fuel and we are losing one engine this time, and we are expecting crash landing and that is all I have to say. we have lost already one engine, and I ask all passengers to react ..... to the hijackers ...."" The hijacker then came back to the cockpit and hit the microphone out of the pilot's hand. After the right engine failed, the pilot started to descend the aircraft in order to increase speed, but the hijacker again interfered and violently played with the controls which resulted in improper control inputs. As a result the autopilot was disconnected and the flight became erratic with the airspeed varying between 216 and 336 kts. As the pilot regained control of the aircraft, the left engine went dead. The hijacker kept on instructing the pilot not to descend and again went to the cabin. Upon returning to the cockpit he saw that the altitude was decreasing, and angrily shouted at the pilot not to go any lower. The pilot said that the fuel was already finished and that the engines were without power. This time the hijacker instructed the captain not to touch the controls, and threatened to kill him. The captain said, ""I am already dead because I am flying an airplane without engine power."" The first officer, who had earlier been forced out to the First Class cabin, got up and, via the right aisle, went to the rear of the aircraft where he saw that a lot of economy class passengers had their life jackets on and that some had already inflated them. The first officer, along with the cabin crew members, helped the passengers to deflate the life jackets and showed them how the jackets should be re-inflated and how to assume the brace position during impact. While returning to the front of the aircraft, they repeated the same instructions as many times as they could.  About less than 2 minutes before the ditching, the co-pilot forced his way to the cockpit shouting ""let me help the pilot ..."". After adjusting his seat and seat belts the pilot asked him for help since the controls were heavy. The hijackers still kept on struggling with the controls. By now, the aircraft was descending into the Indian Ocean over the Comoros Islands. The aircraft now had only standby instruments and RAT (Ram Air Turbine). The altimeter was indicating 150 feet and the airspeed was 200 kts. By this time the flight crew had been left alone to assume control. They turned the aircraft to the left in order to parallel the waves. However, the aircraft brushed the water in a left-wing-low attitude. It was then held straight and level after which it broke into four sections and came to rest in the sheltered waters 500 m off Le Galawa Beach. Of the 175 occupants, 6 crew members and 119 passengers were fatally injured in the accident. Six crew members and 38 passengers sustained serious injuries, 2 passengers sustained minor injuries and 4 passengers received no injury.  Cause: ""The Investigation Committee determines that the cause of this accident was unlawful interference by the hijackers which resulted in loss of engines thrust due to fuel exhaustion."""

An intermediate stop was made in Bangkok (BKK), Thailand. The flight departed Bangkok at 23:02 hours. Some five minutes after takeoff the pilot-in-command stated ""that keeps coming on,"" referring to a REV ISLN advisory warning. This indication appears when a fault has been detected in the thrust reverser system. The crew discussed the REV ISLN indication for about four and one-half minutes. The co-pilot read information from the Airplane Quick Reference Handbook as follows: ""Additional systems failures may cause in- flight deployment"" and ""Expect normal reverser operation after landing."" The pilot-in-command remarked ""....its not just on, its coming on and off,"" he said, ""...its just an advisory thing...,"" and shortly thereafter stated, ""could be some moisture in there or something."" At 23:12, the co-pilot advised the pilot-in-command that there was need for, ""a little bit of rudder trim to the left."" Fifteen minutes and one second into the flight the co-pilot exclaimed, ""ah reverser's deployed,"" accompanied by sound similar to airframe shuddering, sounds of metallic snaps and the pilot-in-command stating ""here wait a minute."" With the deployment of the no. 1 engine thrust reverser, engine thrust was reduced to idle. Aerodynamic effects of the reverser plume in-flight during the engine run down to idle resulted in a 25 percent lift loss across the wing. The airplane stalled and entered an uncontrolled descent. Buffeting, maneuvering overload, and excessive speed caused pieces of the rudder and the left elevator to separate. This was followed by the down-and-aft separation of most of the right horizontal stabilizer from maneuvering overloads, as the crew attempted to control the airplane and arrest the high-speed descent. A torsional overload then caused the separation of the vertical and left horizontal stabilizers. The loss of the tail resulted in a sharp nose-over of the airplane, producing excessive negative loading of the wing. A downward wing failure was probably followed by the breakup of the fuselage. The complete breakup of the tail, wing, and fuselage occurred in a matter of seconds. The wreckage fell in mountainous jungle terrain.  PROBALE CAUSE: ""The Accident Investigation Committee of the Government of Thailand determines the probable cause of this accident to be uncommanded in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser, which resulted in loss of flight path control. The specific cause of the thrust reverser deployment has not been positively identified."""

	   United States of America",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI),"San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO/KSFO)","A Boeing 777-200 passenger jet, operated by Asiana Airlines, was destroyed in a landing accident at San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO). There were 291 passengers and 16 crew members on board. Three passengers died and 48 were seriously injured. Flight OZ-214 originated in Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN), South Korea were it departed at 16:35 local Korean time. Destination of the flight was San Francisco, CA.  The weather at San Francisco was fine with 6-7 knot winds and a visibility of 10+ miles. The pilot undergoing initial operating experience was in the left hand seat as Pilot Flying. An instructor pilot was sitting in the right hand seat. The relief first officer was in the jump seat at the time of the approach. The pilot flying had logged about 9700 flying hours. Flight 214 was his tenth flight leg on a Boeing 777 while undergoing initial operating experience. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 28L, the ILS glidepath of which had been declared unserviceable in the current Notam. The airplane was configured for landing with 30 degrees of flaps and gear down. Target threshold speed was 137 knots. According to preliminary information from the cockpit voice recorder, the crew did not state and anomalies or concerns during the approach. The throttles were at idle and autothrottle armed.  At 1600 feet the autopilot was disengaged. The aircaft descended through an altitude of 1400 ft at 170 kts and slowed down to 149 kts at 1000 feet. At 500 feet altitude, 34 seconds prior to impact, the speed dropped to 134 kts, which was just below the target threshold speed. The airspeed then dropped significantly, reaching 118 knots at 200 feet altitude. The instructor pilot reported that he noticed four red PAPI lights and concluded that the autothrottle had not maintained speed. Eight seconds prior to impact, the throttles were moved forward. Airspeed according to the FDR, was 112 knots at an altitude of 125 feet. Seven seconds prior to impact, one of the crew members made a call to increase speed.  The stick shaker sounded 4 seconds prior to impact. One second later the speed was 103 knots, the lowest recorded by the FDR. One of the crew members made a call for go a around at 1.5 seconds before impact. The throttles were advanced and the engines appeared to respond normally.  The main landing gear and rear fuselage then struck a sea wall, just short of runway 28L. Airspeed was 106 knots. The empennage separated at the rear bulkhead.  The airplane then ballooned, yawed left and spun 360 degrees before it came to rest to the left of runway 28L, 735 m (2400 ft) from the seawall. A post impact fire occurred when a fuel tank ruptured inboard of the no. 2 engine, spilling fuel on the hot engine, causing it to ignite.  The ILS glidepath for runway 28L and 28R at SFO had been declared unserviceable from June 1 until August 22.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances.  Contributing to the accident were;  (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error;  (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems;  (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches;  (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and  (5) flight crew fatigue which likely degraded their performance."

	   Myanmar",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL),Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS),"Singapore Airlines flight SQ321, a Boeing 777-312ER, operating from London-Heathrow to Singapore, encountered severe turbulence en-route. One passenger died, 30 other occupants suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment.   At 07:49:21 UTC the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 ft and likely flying over an area of developing convective activity. The Gravitational force (G), recorded as vertical accelerations, fluctuated between positive (+ve) 0.44G and +ve 1.57G for a period of about 19 seconds. This would have caused the flight to begin to experience slight vibration. Around the same time as the onset of the slight vibration, an uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude, reaching a peak of 37,362 ft, was recorded. In response to this uncommanded altitude increase, the autopilot pitched the aircraft downwards to descend back to the selected altitude of 37,000 ft.  In addition, the pilots observed an uncommanded increase in airspeed which they arrested by extending the speed brakes. While managing the airspeed, at 07:49:32 hr, it was heard that a pilot called out that the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on. This uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude and airspeed were most likely due to the aircraft being acted upon by an updraft (the upward movement of air). The autopilot was engaged during this period.   At 07:49:40 hr, the aircraft experienced a rapid change in G as recorded vertical acceleration decreased from +ve 1.35G to negative (-ve) 1.5G, within 0.6 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne. At 07:49:41 hr, the vertical acceleration changed from -ve 1.5G to +ve 1.5G within 4 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were airborne to fall back down. The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 sec duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 ft, from 37,362 ft to 37,184 ft. This sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers.  In the midst of the sequence of rapid changes in G, recorded data indicated that the pilots initiated control inputs to stabilise the aircraft, disengaging the autopilot in this process. The pilots manually controlled the aircraft for 21 sec and reengaged the autopilot at 07:50:05 hr. The recorded vertical acceleration showed more gradual fluctuations over the next 24 sec, ranging from +ve 0.9G to +ve 1.1G, while the aircraft returned to 37,000 ft at 07:50:23 hr.  After the pilots were informed by the cabin crew that there were injured passengers in the cabin, the decision was made to divert to Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, Thailand. On the way to Bangkok, the pilots requested for medical services to meet the aircraft on arrival. Approximately 17 minutes after the turbulence event, at 08:06:51 hr, the pilots initiated a normal, controlled descent from 37,000 ft and the aircraft reached 31,000 ft at 08:10:00 hr. The data showed that the aircraft did not encounter further severe turbulence during this diversion, and touched down in Suvarnabhumi Airport at 08:45:12 hr."

At 15:15 the flight was cleared for a VOR A approach to runway 26. Wind was given as 180 degrees at 4 knots. Shortly afterwards the controller radioed updated wind information of 160 degrees at 6 knots. The captain then decided to perform a direct approach and landing on runway 08. This was approved by air traffic control. The aircraft touched down 427 m from the runway threshold (LDA 1,440 m) at a speed of 112 kt; Vref was 110 kt with a target touchdown speed of 103 kt.  The aircraft overran runway 08 and ended up in the water of the Beagle Channel.  CAUSE OF ACCIDENT (translated from Spanish): The accident with the BAE-146 aircraft, which occurred at the Puerto Williams Airport, was caused by a failure of operation due to poor planning made by the pilot during the approach phase when he decided to change runway and misapplication of the landing phase procedure. This, in addition to contributing factors such as weather conditions, negative slope, wet track and wind, little braking action, which led to the aircraft leaving the runway."

	   Indonesia",Approach,Cargo,Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ/WAJJ),Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW),"A four-engine Bae-146-300, registered PK-BRD, was destroyed when it impacted a mountainside while on approach to Wamena (WMX), Indonesia. All six crew members were killed. The flight departed Jayapura (DJJ) on an scheduled cargo/passenger flight to Wamena (WMX). The airplane carried staples such as rice and flour. The crew consisted of a captain, co-pilot, engineer, loadmaster and two flight attendants.  The aircraft was being operated under the instrument flight rules (IFR) for the sector from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach and landing at Wamena, because there was no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena. There was low cloud with a base of 300 meters on the final approach track to runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft tracked parallel to, and to the right of the extended runway 15 centreline. During that approach, and while descending through 6,234 feet (790 feet by radio altimeter), the EGPWS voice aural alert 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' sounded. When the aircraft was passing 6,200 feet (991 feet by radio altimeter) on descent, the EGPWS voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounded. The aircraft started turning left toward runway as it was passing 5,719 feet (540 feet radio altimeter) on descent. As the aircraft passed 5,693 feet (516 feet radio altimeter) on descent, the crew informed the controller that they had the runway in sight. During their attempt to intercept the final approach track, while passing 5,531 feet (320 feet radio altimeter) the captain commented to the copilot ""wah nembak lagi"" [we are overshooting again]. During the interception towards the runway an EGPWS voice aural alert 'SINK RATE', sounded. This was immediately followed by the voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounding five times. The copilot instructed the captain ""overshoot, overshoot"" after the second of the five 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounds. The FDR showed that the aircraft commenced a go around from a low height above the runway. The controller offered the crew a choice of a landing on runway 33, but the crew elected to make a right circuit for runway 15. The circuit was flown at a height of between 150 and 350 feet above the aerodrome elevation. During the downwind leg the EGPWS provided the flight crew with eight 'DON'T SINK' and one 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' voice aural alerts. The flight crew did not respond to any of those alerts. As the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 15, the landing gear was lowered for the second landing approach. During the right base turn the aircraft was initially flown at a constant 30 degree angle of right bank. About 100 degrees from runway heading, the copilot said ""OK, sungai ketok"" [OK river in sight]. Four seconds later, when about 85 degrees from runway heading the copilot said ""Pike clear"" [Pike Hill visible]. As the aircraft's heading passed 65 degrees from the runway heading, the copilot called ""be careful pak"" [be careful sir]. A third person in the cockpit commented ""di kiri ada bukit"" [there is a hill on the left]. This was immediately followed, as the aircraft banked through 41 degrees right, by the copilot calling out with increasing concern, ""pak, pak, pak, open pak, kiri, kiri"" [sir, sir, sir, open, sir, left, left]. The engine power was rapidly increased immediately after the copilot called ""open pak"" [open sir]. The copilot commanded ""kiri pak""[left sir] as the captain rolled the aircraft into a left bank and the EGPWS voice aural alert 'DON'T SINK, DON'T SINK' sounded. As the bank angle exceeded 40 degrees, it entered a 10-degree nosedown pitch attitude. The copilot warned the captain ""don't sink"". The captain immediately responded ""ya, ya"". Three seconds later the copilot said ""left turn"". The EGPWS then sounded the following voice aural alerts in rapid succession: 'TOO LOW - TERRAIN', 'BANK ANGLE - BANK ANGLE', 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN'. At the same time as the EGPWS sounded the 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN' warning, the copilot called with high intonation ""pak, pak, pak"" [sir, sir, sir]. The nose-down pitch attitude reached 6 degrees when the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank. As the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank, landing gear retraction commenced. The EGPWS voice aural alert then sounded TERRAIN, and one second later the copilot called ""pak"" [sir]. At the point of impact with the terrain, the landing gear was half way through the retraction cycle, the left bank was 16 degrees, and the aircraft pitch was 12 degrees nose up. The indicated airspeed at impact was 146 knots. The aircraft impacted Pikei Hill on Tengah Mountain.  Wamena Airport is situated at the Baliem Valley with an airport elevation of 5085 feet and surrounded by mountains up to 12.000 feet high. The only navigation aid available is NDB "" ZW"". The instrument approach procedure is not available for this aerodrome. This aerodrome is VFR operation only.  CAUSES: The crew did not appear to have awareness of the aircrafts proximity with terrain until impact with terrain was imminent. The flight crew did not act on the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System aural warnings, and did not conform to the operators published operating procedures. Together, those factors resulted in the aircrafts impact with terrain."

It was still dark just after 06:00 as Comair flight 5191 taxied out for takeoff. The flight was cleared for a runway 22 departure, which is Lexington's main runway. Because the runway was repaved just recently with an added safety area at the approach end of runway 22, one taxiway was no longer in use. Since August 20 the taxi route to runway 22 was changed. The crew inadvertently lined up on the shorter (3500 x 75 feet) and unlit runway 26. The first officer commenced the takeoff roll. One of the pilots made a remark about the lack of runway light illumination, but the takeoff was continued. The fully laden CRJ was not able to rotate within the 3500 feet runway distance and continued past the runway end. It knocked down a metal fence and continued onto a field. The airplane struck several trees and burst into flames on a working farm.  NASA ASRS records show a possible similar scenario when some 13 years earlier a twin engine passenger jet inadvertently taxied into position on runway 26 at LEX while being cleared for an immediate runway 22 takeoff. The tower controller noticed this and cancelled the takeoff clearance. According to the report ""Possible contributing factors were poor visibility and wx (rain), confusing rwy intxn and twr's request for an immediate tkof."" In the meantime work had been performed on the runways at LEX. Since October 2003 for instance a runway resurfacing project was started. The project also added 600 feet of safety area at each runway end.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff.  Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances."""

	   Sweden",En route,Cargo,Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM),Tromsø/Langnes Airport (TOS/ENTC),"A Canadair CRJ-200 cargo plane of West Air Sweden was destroyed when it impacted remote terrain near Akkajaure, Sweden. Both pilots were killed. The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 23:10 hours local time on a mail and package flight to Tromsø, Norway.  The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 00:19:20 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators. Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD). Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The airplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"". About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude. Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning. The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle. The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss.  Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other.  Factors as to cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of a failure in a redundant system.  Contributing factors were: - The absence of an effective system for communication in abnormal and emergency situations. - The flight instrument system provided insufficient guidance about malfunctions that occurred. - The initial manoeuver that resulted in negative G-loads probably affected the pilots' ability to manage the situation in a rational manner.  Factors as to risk The fact that fault descriptions regarding aircraft and its components are reported in a less detailed manner might imply that the faults will not be identified and corrected in an efficient way. This can in turn lead to a flight safety issue as, for instance, intermittent faults cannot always be detected by general tests."

	   Canada",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"Montreal-Dorval International Airport, QC (YUL/CYUL)","Toronto International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","The Douglas DC-8 aircraft was on a regular scheduled flight Montreal-Dorval Airport (YUL) to Toronto (YYZ), Canada, scheduled to leave Montreal at 18:10.  There were some delays in the boarding of the passengers and Flight 831 started its takeoff roll on runway 06R at approximately 18:28. Weather was reported as overcast, light rain and fog, visibility 4 miles, surface wind NE at 12 mph. The flight was instructed to report passing 3000 feet and 7000 feet on the climb-out from the airport.  The aircraft took off normally, reported in at 3,000 feet and acknowledged a clearance for a left turn to St. Eustache. This was the last radio contact with the flight.  The aircraft then deviated from its normal flight path about 55 degrees to the right and began a quick descent. At 18:33, 16.9 miles from the airport, the DC-8 struck the ground at a speed of 470-485 knots descending at an angle of about 55 degrees (+/- 7deg).  It is concluded that the most probable chain of events which occasioned the crash can be identified as follows.  For one of the reasons which are set forth below, the pilot applied the near maximum available Aircraft Nose Down Trim to the horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft then commenced a diving descent building up speed at such a rate that any attempted recovery was ineffective because the stabilizer hydraulic motor had stalled, thus making it impossible within the altitude available to trim the aircraft out of the extreme AND position. (a) The first reason which might have indicated to the pilot the necessity for applying, nose down trim could have been icing of the Pitot system as discussed in the Analysis of Evidence. While the experience and competency of the crew would likely have led them to recognize the fault in time to take corrective action, the possibility that this condition caused the application of AND trim cannot be dismissed. (b) The second reason could have been a failure of a vertical gyro. The evidence indicated that it was possible to have a failure of a vertical gyro without an associated warning flag. If such a failure occurred and the aircraft was being flown with reference to the associated artificial horizon instrument it is likely that the pilot would be misled by the erroneous indication and could have applied nosedown trim. Aircraft CF-TJN was equipped with a standby artificial horizon located on the Captain's instrument panel and this cross reference together with the experience and competency of the crew would likely have led them to recognize the fault in time to take corrective action. Again, the possibility that this condition caused the application of AND trim cannot be dismissed. (c) The third reason could have been an unprogrammed and unnoticed extension of the Pitch Trim Compensator. This would have had the effect of moving the control column back, the elevators up and the aircraft to a nose up condition. The pilot would likely have counteracted the pitch up force of the elevators by trimming the horizontal stabilizer to or near to the limit of the Aircraft Nose Down setting. The evidence shows that the simultaneous application of up elevator from the PTC and the application of as little as 0.5 degrees of Aircraft Nose Down trim on the horizontal stabilizer has an adverse effect on aircraft stability and can create a difficult control problem. The problems of instability and control are more serious as further AND trim is applied. In aircraft CF-TJN 2.0 degrees of AND trim was available and it appears that the pilot applied at least 1.6 degrees of the available trim. It is unlikely that the flight crew were aware of the serious stability and-control problems that we now know can result from the combination of extended PTC and AND trim, even if they had been aware that the PTC had extended. The aircraft would then be in a condition where a slight displacement from its trim point would lead to divergent oscillations. In other words, a minor change. of attitude, easily caused by the existing turbulence, would build up into large displacements. The inadequate control available to the pilot and the lack of an external horizon reference would likely result in the aircraft eventually assuming a dive attitude. It is concluded that an unprogrammed extension of the Pitch Trim Compensator is the most probable cause for the pilot having applied Aircraft Nose Down Trim, which initiated the chain of events that culminated in the crash."

	   Brazil",Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,"São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, SP (CGH/SBSP)","Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, RJ (SDU/SBRJ)","TAM flight 402 was a regular domestic flight between São Paulo (CGH) and Rio de Janeiro (SDU), Brazil. At 08:25 the flight received clearance for takeoff from runway 17R. Wind was given as 060 degrees.  At 08:26:00 the throttles were advanced for takeoff power. Ten seconds later a double beep was heard. The captain said ""O auto-throttle tá fora"" and the copilot adjusted the throttles manually and informed the captain: ""thrust check"". With this information he confirmed that the takeoff power had been adjusted and verified. At 08:26:19 the airplane accelerated through 80 kts. At 08:26:32 the copilot indicated ""V one"". Two seconds later the airplane rotated at a speed of 131 kts.  The speed increased to 136 kts and the airplane was climbing at an angle of 10 degrees. At that same moment a shock was felt and the EPR of engine no. 2 dropped from 1.69 to 1.34, indicating the loss of power. In fact, the no. 2 engine thrust reverser had deployed. An eye witness confirmed to have seen at least two complete cycles of opening and closing of the no. 2 thrust reverser buckets during the flight. The loss of power on the right side caused the plane to roll to the right. The captain applied left rudder and left aileron to counteract the movement of the plane. The copilot advanced both thrust levers, but they retarded again almost immediately, causing the power of the no. 1 engine to drop to 1.328 EPR and engine no. 2 to 1,133 EPR. Both crew members were preoccupied by the movement of the throttles and did not know that the thrust reverser on the no. 2 engine had deployed. The throttles were forced forward again. At 08:26:44 the captain ordered the autothrottle to be disengaged. One second later the no. 2 thrust lever retarded again and remained at idle for two seconds. The airspeed fell to 126 kts. At 08:26:48 the copilot announced that he had disengaged the autothrottles. He then jammed the no. 2 thrust lever fully forward again. Both engines now reached 1,724 EPR. With the thrust reverser deployed, the airspeed declined at 2 kts per second. At 08:26:55 the stick shaker activated, warning of an impending stall. The airplane rolled to a 39 degree bank angle and the GPWS activated: ""Don't sink!"". Seven seconds later the airplane impacted a building and crashed into a heavily populated neighborhood.  a. Contributing Factors Psychological Aspect - Contributed a) organizational aspect  The lack of information, instructions in writing and practice, contributed to the non-recognition of the abnormality during its unfolding. b) Individual aspect The unusual occurrence of the quick reduction of the lever, on a particularly difficult phase of the operation (transition from take-off run to flight); the nonoccurrence of failure discriminating (sound and visual) warnings, and the lack of cognizance and specific training for such abnormality bring on surprise and distraction of the crew members' attention. - The release of the restriction of the lever of engine 2 at the idle detent without the occurrence of the abnormality warnings strengthened the tendency (in at least one of the crew members) to try to recover the power on the engine. - The lack of warnings and the difficulties that are characteristic of such abnormality have diverted the crew members' concentration from the procedures provided for, to concentrate it on the solution of the abnormality, initially imagined as being an auto-throttle failure, and later the recovery of thrust - The occurrence of auto-throttle failure warnings (before the 80 Kt) and the lack of specific reverse opening warnings (Master Caution and RSVS UNLK) have strengthened, in the crew members, the belief that they were experiencing an autothrottle failure (illusion).  b. Material Factor (1). Desing Deficiency - Contributed  The reverser fault tree chart made recently by the manufacturer considering the Post-Mod version, even not taking into account a dormant fail, has indicated that the probability of an inadvertent opening of the reversers is of the order of 10""6. The Post-Mod version does not meet the airworthiness requirements of FAR/RBHA 25.1309. On two phases of the complete reversers cycle, at the beginning of the opening and at the end of the shell closing, it is possible to apply power higher than IDLE with the shells partially open, which does not meet RBHA/FAR 25.933. The reverser unlocked indication system is inhibited at speeds higher than 80 Kt and up to the height of 1000 feet, exactly at an instant when the pilots would need such information most. The SECONDARY LOCK ACTUATORS (S/N 874 and S/N 870) that equipped the aircraft that suffered the accident, on the operational tests proposed and carried out, presented a performance much below the minimum acceptable to assure the safety and reliability of the system. The applicable FAR 25.993(a)(3) requirements determine that each [reverse] system is to be provided with means to prevent the engine from producing power higher than idle power upon a failure on the reverse system [not stipulating the type of failure]. Such requirement has not been complied with, both in relation to the control system, which permitted the shells to open in flight, and in relation to protection, which became non-existent when the separation of the FEEDBACK CABLE occurred due to the unpredicted pilot's action on the lever, with the intention of recovering the power of the affected engine. The TURNBUCKLE is installed on the side to which the connection moves when the reverser is commanded to open, i.e., the same side towards which the connection moves when the situation occurs in which the lever is forcibly held forward while the reverser is opening (deploying). The THRUST SELECTOR VALVE may be moved with less than 2% of the normal functioning pressure, when the selector valve is de-energized, which was the condition at the time of the accident. The inductive loads as those of SEC. LCK. ACTUATOR are detrimental to the contacts that command them, particularly on de-energization, in case there is no protection diode, which is apparently the case of SEC. LCK. ACTUATOR. The THRUST REVERSER ACTUATOR, in the Post-Mod configuration, incorporated to the assembly line by the manufacturer, remains de-energized during the periods in which there is no commanding by the pilot, and this way it stays in an unstable and dangerous situation.

	   Japan",Landing,Cargo,Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN/ZGGG),Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA),"FedEx flight 80 departed Guangzhou (CAN), China on a cargo flight to Tokyo-Narita (NRT) with the first officer likely acting as pilot flying. The airplane contacted Narita Tower at 06:41 and received a landing clearance for runway 34L. Wind information passed on to the crew indicated gusting winds. As the airplane was probably flying through rough air, the autopilot and autothrottle had difficulties to control airspeed and attitude.  At 06:47:40 the CAWS announced 500 ft. The calibrated airspeed (CAS) was frequently fluctuating and at this moment the CAS was about 179 kts. The range of CAS fluctuation was from 152 to 180 kt which was 12 kts slower and 16 kts faster than the selected approach speed of 164 kts. This exceeded the stabilized approach criteria. The pilot monitoring called ""stabilize"" and most likely let the pilot flying continue approaching, disregarding airspeed deviation of more than Vapp plus 10 kt.  The autopilot was disconnected at 198 ft radio altitude, while the autothrottle remained engaged. The pitch angle then decreased from 1.4° while the CAS was 178.5 kts. The airplane was almost on the glide slope at this point. Just after the autopilot was disconnected, the pitch angle temporarily decreased as low as 0.4° but it increased to 3.5° by the time the airplane descended to 92 ft.  In the meantime, the CAS decreased as low as 154 ft (Vapp minus 10 kt) and the airplane descended about half a dot below the glide slope. It is highly probable that this large speed decrease stemmed from the inability of the autothrottle system to counteract the large wind velocity change (decreasing head wind component) during the descent and the fact that the thrust was kept at idle during the increment of the pitch angle to 3.5°. The increased pitch angle and corresponding column input indicates the pilot flying's intention to correct the lowered flight path.  The CAS increased to 161 kt from 154 kt, but it was still slower than Vapp (164 kt). The deviation from the glide slope had increased to -1.11 dot.  The pilot flying began correcting the heading to correct for the cross wind component from the left and align the longitudinal axis with the runway centerline.  When the radio altimeter indicated about 48 ft, the pitch angle was 1.1° and a sink rate was about 13 fps. The autothrottle was engaged, and the thrust levers were in the retard mode which started to automatically decrease the thrust below 50 ft, reaching idle when descending through 20 ft.  The pilot flying initiated the flare later than usual at 20 ft, not at 30 ft. Rapid and large column input during flare indicates the pilot's recognition of the late flare. The pitch angle remained 1.1° (about 2° lower than usual) until the flare, and the pitch angle temporarily decreased to 0.7° (below 20 ft) followed by the quick increment of the pitch angle to 4.6° in 2 seconds before touchdown.  The control column was pushed largely forward (-4.9°) just before the touchdown. The airplane consequently experienced a large sink rate upon the first touchdown as high as 7 fps. Vertical acceleration spiked to 1.63 G and the airplane bounced. The forward control column input just before and during the touchdown most likely resulted in the rapid derotation from 4.6° at the first touchdown to below zero in 1.5 seconds. The decreasing pitch angle, with the main landing gear still in the air, may have made it difficult for the pilot flying to recognize the need for bounce recovery due to his lowering eye point. It may be possible that he didn't realize the airplane had bounced. The airplane then touched down on the nose landing gear with a pitch angle of -1.8°, followed later by the main landing gear. After touchdown the nosegear rebounded off quickly increasing the pitch angle, leading to increased lift, resulting in a high bounce to 16 ft above the runway.  The nose dropped again and the airplane landed on the nosegear followed by the main landing gears. As the airplane was rolling to the left, the left main gear first touched down, followed by the center landing gear and the right main gear. The recorded vertical acceleration at this time was 3.06 G. The airplane sink rate was estimated to be 21.5 fps at the third touchdown. It is highly probable that the airplanes kinetic energies at the third touchdown exceeded the certification requirements by almost seven times.  The left wing attachment point to the fuselage fractured. The fuselage rolled to the left with the lift generated by the right wing and a fire erupted. The airplane rolled inverted and was consumed by fire.  PROBABLE CAUSES: In this accident, when the airplane landed on Runway 34L at Narita International Airport, it fell into porpoising. It is highly probable that the left wing fractured as the load transferred from the left MLG to the left wing structure on the third touchdown surpassed the design limit (ultimate load).  It is highly probable that a fire broke out as the fuel spillage from the left wing caught fire, and the airplane swerved left off the runway rolling to the left and came to rest inverted on the grass area.  The direct causes which the airplane fell into the porpoise phenomenon are as follows:  a. Large nose-down elevator input at the first touchdown resulted in a rapid nose-down motion during the first bounce, followed by the second touchdown on the NLG with negative pitch attitude. Then the pitch angle rapidly increased by the ground reaction force, causing the larger second bounce, and  b. The PF's large elevator input in an attempt to control the airplane without thrust during the second bounce.  In addition, the indirect causes are as follows:  a. Fluctuating airspeed, pitch attitude due to gusty wind resulted in an approach with a large sink rate,  b. Late flare with large nose-up elevator input resulted in the first bounce and  c. Large pitch attitude change during the bounce possibly made it difficult for the crewmembers to judge airplane pitch attitude and airplane height relative to the ground (MLG height above the runway).  d. The PM's advice, override and takeover were not conducted adequately.  It is somewhat likely that, if the fuse pin in the MLG support structure had failed and the MLG had been separated in the overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component, the damage to the fuel tanks would have been reduced to prevent the fire from developing rapidly.  It is probable that the fuse pin did not fail because the failure mode was not assumed under an overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component due to the interpretation of the requirement at the time of type certification for the MD-11 series airplanes."

All 173 passengers and seven crew members were killed. Inex Adria flight 1308 was a charter service from Ljubljana, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) to Ajaccio, Corsica, France. The flight departed at 07:41 local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL330. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. About 08:35, while descending to FL190, a the copilot's son entered the flight deck and was allowed to take the observers seat. Further descent instructions and radar vectors were obtained and at 08:47 the flight transferred to the Ajaccio Approach controller. The controller cleared the flight to the AJO VOR at FL110 and to report when overhead the VOR. He also passed on weather information and the reported that runway 21 was the runway in use. At 08:49 the crew reported over the AJO VOR. The controller cleared the flight to descend to 3300 feet on the 247 radial of the AJO VOR. Three minutes later the flight radioed: ""Rolling inbound out of six thousand"". By that time the airplane had descended below the minimum holding altitude of 6800 feet for that area. He then reported: ""Turning inbound to Ajaccio because at the moment we are in cloud."" The controller then replied: ""Roger, 1308, report Charlie Tango on final, surface wind two eight zero degrees, twenty knots."" There was no response from flight 1308. Flight 1308 was flying a holding pattern to lose altitude, but the controller believed the aircraft was going to make a direct descent to begin the final approach. Hence the reference to the Charlie Tango (CT) NDB beacon. After several aural GPWS warnings (starting 13 seconds before impact) the crew increased engine thrust relatively slowly and pulled up too late. The left wing contact the top of Mont San-Pietro. Control was lost and the airplane crashed in mountainous terrain.  CAUSES (translated from original French language report): 1. The Committee considers that the cause of this accident was that the descent undertaken by the crew led the aircraft to find itself in clouds below the instruments safety altitude for that part of the flight path. 2. The Committee noted that when the crew, alerted by the GPWS, tried to regain altitude, the maneuver proved to be insufficient to overcome the effect of strong descending air currents due to relief and strong wind, present in the area where the aircraft was flying at that time.  OTHER FACTORS The Commission further noted that the combination of the following factors contributed to the crew being put in a situation it could not overcome:  1. The committee felt that the crew did not show the necessary rigor when preparing its approach. It does not appear that a logical order has guided the crew in the revision and memorization of various parameters, including the safe altitude and the maximum speed of the holding circuit, which in any case, did not catch the attention of the crew in an appropriate manner. In addition, the presence of a young child on the observer seat cockpit, until the end of the flight was a dispersion factor of attention;  2. The misunderstandings which have developed in the exchange of messages between the captain and the approach controller could disrupt, at certain times, the working conditions of the crew. The controller consequently did not have an accurate representation of the progress of the aircraft in the performance of its procedure and, therefore, did not intervene when two messages ""call you inbound on radial two forty seven"", and then ""rolling inbound out of six thousand"" would have told him, if he had better interpreted them, an ambiguous situation for the first and abnormal and dangerous for the second;  3. The advice to the commission on vectoring habits and on habits supposedly used by some national air traffic services to systematically take into account the safety altitudes in formulating control permissions, leads to the suspicion that some crew have a slightest concern about the safe altitudes;  4. Airspeed of the aircraft was greater than the maximum speed of the holding pattern and crew did not adopt the correction factors adapted to altitude wind they had encountered during the previous segment th flight. This led to the airplane overfly an area where, although it is included in the protected area of the holding pattern, the upper air movements were particularly important;  5. The symbolic representation of the holding pattern on the approach chart used by the crew corresponds to a path, with no wind, and an aircraft which would have approximately 150 knots indicated airspeed. It calls not evident attention to Airmen on the actual dimensions of the actually travelled circuits in flight, nor therefore on altitude over the terrain reliefs."

	   Venezuela",En route,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Panama City-Tocumen International Airport (PTY/MPTO),Fort de France-Lamentin Airport (FDF/TFFF),"The MD-82 arrived at Panama City-Tocumen after a flight from Medellín-José María Córdova Airport (MDE). The plane was then prepared to carry out a flight to the Caribbean island of Martinique.  Flight WCW 708 departed Panama City at about 06:00 UTC and climbed to its cruising altitude of FL310.  This altitude was reached at about 06:25 UTC. Sixteen minutes later the airplane began a normal climb to FL330. At 06:49 the speed began to steadily decrease from Mach 0.76. The horizontal stabilizer moved from about 2 units nose up to about 4 units nose up during this deceleration. At 06:51 UTC the crew reported at FL330 over the SIDOS waypoint, over the Colombian/Venezuelan border, and requested a direct course to the ONGAL waypoint. The controller instructed the crew to continue on the present heading and to await further clearance direct to ONGAL. The flight crew meanwhile discussed weather concerns that included possible icing conditions and the possible need to turn on engine and airfoil anti-ice.  At 06:57 UTC the flight crew requested permission to descend to FL310, which was approved. The autopilot was disconnected and the airplane started to descend. As the airplane descended past about FL315, the airspeed continued to decrease and the engine EPR decreased to about flight idle. Two minutes later a further descent to FL290 was requested, but the controller at Maiquetía did not understand that this was a request from flight 708 and asked who was calling. Flight 708 responded and immediately requested descent to FL240. The controller inquired about the state of the aircraft, to which they responded that both engines had flamed out. The controller then cleared the flight to descent at pilot's discretion.  In the meantime, the altitude alert warning had activated, followed by the stick shaker and the aural stall warning alert. The airspeed had reached a minimum of about 150 indicated air speed (IAS) knots at about FL250. The crew reported descending through FL140 and reported that they were not able to control the airplane. The aircraft descended at 7000 ft/min, and finally crashed in a swampy area. The entire descent from FL330 had taken approx. 3 minutes and 30 seconds.  CAUSE (translated from Spanish): Given the aerodynamic and performance conditions, the aircraft was taken to a critical state, which led to this loss of lift. Consequently, the cockpit resource management (CRM) and decision-making during the development of emergency were misguided. This was caused by the following: a) Awareness of environment (or situational awareness) insufficient or improper that allowed the cockpit crew, not being full and timely aware of what was happening regarding the performance and behavior of the aircraft. b) Lack of effective communication between the cockpit crew that limited, within the decision making process, the possibility to timely choose appropriate alternatives and options and to set respective priorities in the actions taken at the time when it was established that there was a critical or emergency situation (stall condition at high altitude).  It is found that the cause of the accident is determined by the absence of appropriate action to correct the stall of the aircraft, and also in the emergency up to the impact with the ground, at an inappropriate hierarchy of priorities in implementing the procedures. Subsequently, the operations were conducted outside of the limits and parameters set by the manufacturer's manual performance, together with an inadequate flight planning by failing to consider meteorological aspects, in addition a misinterpretation and late  of the energy state of the aircraft by the flight crew. Therefore, the evidence shows the classification of ""Human Factor"" as a cause of this accident."

All fifty passengers and seven crew members were killed. Flight 4203 departed Istanbul-Atatürk Airport at 00:50 hours on a domestic flight to Isparta. The flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 05. After crossing the IPT VOR beacon at the airport, the flight was supposed to have a course of 223°. At 12 DME, the aircraft then should have turned right onto runway heading. However, the flight crew failed to program the arrival procedure into the FMS. After crossing the IPT VOR, the aircraft headed 253° and turned right over rising terrain. The EGPWS failed to sound as the aircraft flew towards the 1,830 metres (6,000 ft) tall Türbetepe hill. The airplane impacted the top of the hill and broke up. The plane's wings and engines came to rest at the top of the hill while the fuselage was found 500 feet lower.  The investigation revealed that the EGPWS had failed repeatedly (86 times on the past 235 flights) and that it had been installed on another aircraft before being installed on TC-AKM ten days before the accident. Additionally, it appeared that both flight crew members were inexperienced and lacked training. It was determined that the captain trained on the simulator for 20 hours instead of the mandatory 32 hours. The first officer attended simulator in Sofia for 32 hours, but these hours were not documented."

The flight departed Lukhovitsy at 14:52, with an expected time of arrival at Vnukovo Airport of 15:40 hours.   The autopilot was engaged after takeoff at a true altitude of 550 feet. At the fifth minute of flight, from almost horizontal flight at an altitude of 5160 feet (the pitch angle values ​​were 5-6 degrees nose-up, the recorded angles of attack were 10-11 degrees), the aircraft began to descend with a pitch angle of up to 4 degrees nose down. At the moment of transition to descent, the indicated speed was 200 knots and increasing, and the flaps and slats were simultaneously retracted to the fully retracted position. During the descent, the autopilot and autothrottle were turned off. The descent continued to an altitude of 4,500 feet followed by a climb to 4,750 feet. At the sixth minute of the flight, at a speed of 320 knots (with the OVERSPEED warning alarm active), the aircraft began to descend with an increasing nose down pitch angle.

	   Japan",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Chiang Kai Shek International Airport (TPE/RCTP),Nagoya-Komaki International Airport (NGO/RJNN),"China Airlines Flight 140 departed from Taipei International Airport, Taiwan, bound for Nagoya Airport, Japan. After initial descent and contact with Nagoya Approach Control, the flight was cleared for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 34 (ILS 34 approach) and was switched to the Nagoya tower frequency at approximately 2007 local time. It was nighttime and Nagoya airport weather at the time was reported as winds from 280 degrees at 8 knots, visibility of 20 kilometers, cumulus clouds at 3,000 feet and a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. During the initial phase of the approach, both autopilot systems (AP1 and AP2) were engaged as well as the auto throttles. After passing the ILS outer marker and receiving landing clearance, the first officer, who was the pilot flying, disengaged the autopilot system and continued the ILS approach manually. When passing through approximately 1,000 feet on the approach glidepath, the first officer inadvertently triggered the GO levers placing the auto throttles into go-around mode, which led to an increase in thrust. This increase in thrust caused the aircraft to level off at approximately 1,040 feet for 15 seconds and resulted in the flight path becoming high relative to the ILS glideslope. The captain recognized that the GO lever had been triggered and instructed the first officer to disengage it and correct the flight path down to the desired glide slope. While manually trying to correct the glide path with forward yoke, the first officer engaged the autopilot, causing it to be engaged in the go-around mode as well. As he manually attempted to recapture the glide slope from above by reducing thrust and pushing the yoke forward, he was providing pitch inputs to the elevator that were opposite the autopilot commands to the THS, which was attempting to command pitch up for a go around. The THS progressively moved from -5.3 degrees to its maximum nose-up limit of approximately -12.3 degress as the aircraft passed through approximately 880 feet. During this period the first officer continued to apply increasing manual nose-down command through forward yoke control which resulted in increasing nose-down elevator movement, opposite the THS movement, masking the out-of-trim condition. The first officer attempted to use the pitch trim control switch to reduce the control force required on the yoke. However, because pitch trim control of the THS is inhibited during autopilot operation, it had no effect. In a normal, trimmed condition the THS and elevator should remain closely aligned. However, because of the opposing autopilot (nose up) commanded THS and manually commanded elevator (nose down) for approximately 30 seconds, the THS and elevator became ""mis-trimmed"".  Passing through approximately 700 feet, the autopilot was disengaged but the THS remained at its last commanded position of -12.3 degrees. Also at this time, due to the thrust reduction commanded by the first officer, the airspeed decreased to a low level, resulting in an increasing angle of attack (also termed alpha, or AOA). As a result, the automatic alpha floor function of the aircraft was activated, causing an increase in thrust and a further pitch-up. The alpha floor function of the A300 is an AOA protection feature intended to prevent excessive angles of attack during normal operations. Because of the greater size of the THS relative to the elevator (approximately three times greater in terms of surface area), the available elevator control power or authority was overcome as the aircraft neared 570 feet on the approach. Upon hearing the first officer report that he could not push the nose further down and that the throttles had latched (alpha floor function engaged), the captain took over the controls unaware of the THS position. Upon assuming control, the captain initially attempted to continue the approach but was surprised by the strong resistive force to his full nose-down control inputs. He retarded the throttles in an attempt to recapture glide slope. Unable to control the increasing nose-up pitch, which had reached 22 degrees, he called for the GO-lever shortly thereafter in attempt to execute a go around. The increasing thrust added additional nose-up pitch moment and resulted in and uncontrolled steep climb as airspeed continued to decrease and AOA continued to rise. During the attempted go-around, the captain only operated the pitch trim briefly, indicating he was unaware of the mis-trimmed position (extreme nose-up) of the THS. Furthermore, flaps/slats had been retracted two positions (30/40 to 15/15) to the go-around setting, which increased the airplane pitch up and reduced the stall margin. The aircraft continued to climb steeply up to 1,730 feet with AOA rapidly increasing and airspeed decreasing, reaching a maximum pitch angle of approximately 53 degrees until the stall warning and subsequent stall. Once stalled the aircraft nose lowered to a steep dive and the captain applied full aft yoke in an attempt to recover from the dive; however, the aircraft remained stalled until impacting the  ground tail-first, 300 feet to the right of the runway and burst into flames.  CAUSES: While the aircraft was making an ILS approach to runway 34 of Nagoya Airport, under manual control by the F/O, the F/O inadvertently activated the GO lever, which changed the FD (Flight Director) to GO AROUND mode and caused a thrust increase. This made the aircraft deviate above its normal glide path. The APs were subsequently engaged, with GO AROUND mode still engaged. Under these conditions the F/O continued pushing the control wheel in accordance with the CAP's instructions. As a result of this, the THS (Horizontal Stabilizer) moved to its full nose-up position and caused an abnormal out-of-trim situation. The crew continued approach, unaware of the abnormal situation. The AOA increased the Alpha Floor function was activated and the pitch angle increased. It is considered that, at this time, the CAP (who had now taken the controls), judged that landing would be difficult and opted for go-around. The aircraft began to climb steeply with a high pitch angle attitude. The CAP and the F/O did not carry out an effective recovery operation, and the aircraft stalled and crashed.  The AAIC determined that the following factors, as a chain or a combination thereof, caused the accident:   * The F/O inadvertently triggered the Go lever. It is considered that the design of the GO lever contributed to it: normal operation of the thrust lever allows the possibility of an inadvertent triggering of the GO lever. * The crew engaged the APs while GO AROUND mode was still engaged, and continued approach. * The F/O continued pushing the control wheel in accordance with the CAP's instructions, despite its strong resistive force, in order to continue the approach. * The movement of the THS conflicted with that of the elevators, causing an abnormal out-of-trim situation. * There was no warning and recognition function to alert the crew directly and actively to the onset of the abnormal out-of-trim condition. * The CAP and F/O did not sufficiently understand the FD mode change and the AP override function. It is considered that unclear descriptions of the AFS (Automatic Flight System) in the FCOM (Flight Crew Operating Manual) prepared by the aircraft manufacturer contributed to this. * The CAP's judgment of the flight situation while continuing approach was inadequate, control take-over was delayed, and appropriate actions were not taken.  *  The Alpha-Floor function was activated; this was incompatible with the abnormal out-of-trim situation, and generated a large pitch-up moment. This narrowed the range of selection for recovery operations and reduced the time allowance for such operations. *  The CAP's and F/O's awareness of the flight conditions, after the PlC took over the controls and during their recovery operation, was inadequate respectively. *  Crew coordination between the CAP and the F/O was inadequate. *  The modification prescribed in Service Bulletin SB A300-22-602 1 had not been incorporated into the aircraft. *  The aircraft manufacturer did not categorise the SB A300-22-6021 as ""Mandatory"", which would have given it the highest priority. The airworthiness authority of the nation of design and manufacture did not issue promptly an airworthiness directive pertaining to implementation of the above SB."

A flap fault occurred while the flight was on the approach; this caused the crew to ask for clearance back to Calcutta, a decision that was in keeping with both Company and performance requirements, which necessitate the use of full flaps for the steep final approach. Shortly (21 seconds) after making this request, at a distance of approximately 12 nm from the Kathmandu VOR, the flap fault was rectified by retracting and then reselecting the flaps. The crew determined that it was not possible to continue the straight-in approach, due to the steep descent angles required and the position of the aircraft. The crew stated to the control tower that they wished to start their approach again and requested a left turn back to the Romeo fix, which is 41 nm south south-west (202 radial) of the Kathmandu VOR. The Controller, in the non-radar environment, responded by clearing the flight to make the Sierra approach, which starts at the 202 radial and 16 nautical miles from the VOR. The crew response to the clearance was to report that, at the moment, they couldn't land and to ask again for left turn back to Romeo to start their approach again. After further dialogue with the controller, which included requests for a left turn, the crew unilaterally initiated a right turn from the aircraft's 025 degree heading and commenced a climb from an altitude of 10,500 feet to FL180, when the flight was about 7 nm south of the Kathmandu VOR. The crew reported to the tower controller that the flight was climbing and the controller replied by instructing the crew to report at 16 nm for the Sierra approach. During the turn, there was more discussion between the tower controller and the flight, where it was established that the aircraft was to maintain an altitude of FL115 and was to ""proceed to Romeo"" and contact the Area Control Center (ACC) controller. The flight, commencing a descent while in the turn, completed a 360-degree turn, momentarily rolling out on headings of 045 and 340 degrees, and again proceeded toward the north on a heading of 025 degrees magnetic. When the flight was about 5 nm south-west of the Kathmandu VOR, the crew contacted the ACC and stated that the aircraft was ""heading 025"" and they wished to proceed to Romeo to start their approach again; adding they had ""technical problems concerned with the flight."" It was again established that the flight was to proceed to Romeo and the crew agreed to ""report over Romeo."" It was determined from the cockpit voice recorder that the crew was in the process of inserting ""Romeo"" and other related navigational information in the Flight Management System, but were experiencing difficulties. The flight continued towards the north on a heading of 025 degrees and then, at about 16 nm north, the heading was altered to the left to 005 degrees. Slightly over one minute later, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded the warning ""terrain"" ""terrain"" followed by ""whoop whoop pull-up""; the aural warning continued until impact approximately 16 seconds later. Engine thrust was increasing and ""Level Change"" had been announced on the cockpit, just before the impact occurred at the 11,500-foot level of a 16,000-foot peak; the accident site was located on the 015 radial (north-north east) at 23.3 nm from the Kathmandu VOR.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""TG311 flight crew's management of the aircraft flight path wherein the flight proceeded in a northerly direction which was opposite to the cleared point Romeo to the South; ineffective radio communication between the area control centre and the TG311 flight crew which allowed the flight to continue in the wrong direction, in that the TG311 crew never provided the aircraft's VOR radial when stating DME and the controller never solicited this information and thus the aircraft's position was not transmitted at any time; and ineffective cockpit crew coordination by the TG311 crew in conducting flight navigation duties. Contributing factors were: the misleading depiction of Romeo on the operator's approach chart used by the flight crew; a flap fault, although corrected, required that the initial approach be discontinued; and radio communication difficulties between the TG311 crew and the air traffic controllers that stemmed from language difficulties and ineffective discussion of apparent unresolved problems."""

Approximately 1nm from touchdown, at about 600 feet amsl and at an airspeed of 185 mph the crew requested a left-hand orbit (360 degree turn) because they were too high and fast on the approach. During the tight (36degree bank angle) left hand turn the flaps were fully extended and the landing checklist completed. When the aircraft crossed the extended runway centerline the crew reported they wanted to abort the landing. A controller gave the crew clearance to climb to 2,500 feet at a 300-degree heading to prepare for another approach. The plane's speed began increasing to 185 knots as it began to climb to 1000 feet in a 5-degree nose-up attitude. During the go-around at approximately 1,000 feet, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, 15-degrees nose down. As the GPWS sounded, the captain ordered the flaps to be raised and moved the sidestick aft. The Airbus impacted the sea at a 6.5-degreee nose down angle, north of the airport. The plane's last recorded airspeed was about 280 knots. Two very remarkable accidents happened June 1950 within a period of just 3 days. On June 12 an Air France DC-4 descended into the sea while on a night-time approach to Bahrain. Two days later, another Air France DC-4 descended into the sea off Bahrain, also on a night-time approach.  The investigation showed that no single factor was responsible for the accident to GF-072. The accident was the result of a fatal combination of many contributory factors, both at the individual and systemic levels. All of these factors must be addressed to prevent such an accident happening again. (1) The individual factors particularly during the approach and final phases of the flight were: (a) The captain did not adhere to a number of SOPs; such as: significantly higher than standard aircraft speeds during the descent and the first approach; not stabilising the approach on the correct approach path; performing an orbit, a non-standard manoeuvre, close to the runway at low altitude; not performing the correct go-around procedure; etc. (b) In spite of a number of deviations from the standard flight parameters and profile, the first officer (PNF) did not call them out, or draw the attention of the captain to them, as required by SOPs. (c) A perceptual study indicated that during the go-around after the orbit, it appears that the flight crew experienced spatial disorientation, which could have caused the captain to perceive (falsely) that the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose-down input, and as a result, the aircraft descended and flew into the shallow sea. (d) Neither the captain nor the first officer perceived, or effectively responded to, the threat of increasing proximity to the ground, in spite of repeated hard GPWS warnings. (2) The systemic factors, identified at the time of the above accident, which could have led to the above individual factors, were: (a) Organisational factors (Gulf Air): (i) A lack of training in CRM contributing to the flight crew not performing as an effective team in operating the aircraft. (ii) Inadequacy in the airline's A320 training programmes, such as: adherence to SOPs, CFIT, and GPWS responses. (iii) The airlines flight data analysis system was not functioning satisfactorily, and the flight safety department had a number of deficiencies. (iv) Cases of non-compliance, and inadequate or slow responses in taking corrective actions to rectify them, on the part of the airline in some critical regulatory areas, were identified during three years preceding the accident. (b) Safety oversight factors: A review of about three years preceding the accident indicated that despite intensive efforts, the DGCAM as a regulatory authority could not make the operator comply with some critical regulatory requirements."

	   Pakistan",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Karachi-Jinnah International Airport (KHI/OPKC),Islamabad-Benazir Bhutto International Airport (ISB/OPRN),"An Airbus passenger plane was destroyed when it crashed in the Margalla Hills near Islamabad-Benazir Bhutto International Airport (ISB), Pakistan. All six crew members and 146 passengers on board were killed. Flight 202 had departed Karachi International Airport (KHI) on a domestic service to Islamabad.  Weather at Islamabad was poor with deteriorating visibility. A PIA flight had landed on the third attempt to land and a flight from China had returned. ABQ202 was cleared for a runway 12 Circling Approach procedure. During the approach the captain descended below Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) (i.e. 2,300 ft instead of maintaining 2,510 ft), losing visual contact with the airfield. The captain then decided to fly a non-standard self-created PBD (Place Bearing Distance, RNAV waypoint)-based approach, thus transgressing out of the protected airspace by an distance of 4.3 NM into the Margalla Hills area. The captain did not take appropriate action following calls from the first officer. He also did not respond to 21 EGPWS warnings related to approaching rising terrain and pull up. The airplane flew into the side of a mountain. The first officer remained a passive bystander in the cockpit and did not participate as an effective team member failing to supplement and compliment or to correct the errors of his captain assertively due to the captains behaviour in the flight. The investigation report said that during initial climb, the captain tested the knowledge of the first officer and used harsh words and a snobbish tone, contrary to the company procedure/norms. The question/answer sessions, lecturing and advices by the captain continued with intervals for about one hour after takeoff. After the intermittent humiliating sessions, the FO generally remained quiet, suffered from underconfidence, became submissive and subsequently did not challenge the captain for any of his errors, breaches and violations.  FINALIZATION: ""Air blue crash has been finalized as a case of Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT), in which aircrew failed to display superior judgment and professional skills in a self created unsafe environment. In their pursuit to land in inclement weather, they committed serious violations of procedures and breaches of flying discipline, which put the aircraft in an unsafe condition over dangerous terrain at low altitude."""

	   Libya",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR),Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT),"Afriqiyah Airways flight 771, an Airbus A330-202, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya. There were 11 crew members and 93 passengers on board. One passenger survived the accident. On May 11, 2010 at 19:45 UTC, the aircraft departed Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB), South Africa on an international passenger flight to Tripoli. The co-pilot was pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.  The captain contacted the Tripoli ACC controller at 05:29 local time (02:29 UTC) and received clearance direct to Tripoli for a TW locator approach to runway 09. Weather was reported as: wind calm, visibility 6 km, clear sky, temperature/dew point 19/17°C, QNH 1008. After receiving further descent clearances, the crew contacted the Tripoli Tower controller at 05:58. Tripoli Tower cleared the aircraft to continue the approach and to report runway in sight. The flight then received information from a flight that had landed ahead of them, informing the accident crew about fog patches noticed during short final. At 06:00 the flight passed the TW locator beacon at an altitude of 1000 feet, 200 ft below the prescribed altitude. The captain then informed ATC that he would report when runway in sight. The approach was continued below the Minimum Descent Altitude of 620 feet but the crew still did not have the runway in sight. At an altitude of 280 feet the GPWS sounded ('too low terrain'). The captain then instructed the co-pilot to execute a go-around, after which he informed the Tower controller. The aircraft began to climb, reaching an altitude of 450 feet above ground level. The Airbus then nosed down, causing the captain to take priority over the flight controls by pushing on priority button and the aircraft was fully under the captain's control who applied a sharp nose down input. The captain did not verbally state that he was taking control. He applied a pitch-up and a pitch-down input on his stick until the airplane impacted the ground 1200 m from the threshold of runway 09 with high energy (-4400 ft/min) and high longitudinal velocity (260 kts). The aircraft broke up, leaving an 800 m long wreckage trail.  PROBABLE CAUSE: A final approach carried out in common managed guidance mode should have relieved the crew of their tasks. The limited coordination and cooperation between the two crew members, especially the change into vertical selected guidance mode by the PF, probably led to a lack of a common action plan. The lack of feedback from the 28 April 2010 flight, flown by the same crew on the same aircraft, did not allow them to anticipate the potential risks associated with managing non-precision approaches. The pilots'  performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined. During the go-around, the crew was surprised not to acquire visual references. On one hand the crew feared exceeding the aircrafts speed limits in relation to its configuration, and on the other hand they were feeling the effects of somatogravic illusion due to the aircraft acceleration. This probably explains the aircraft handling inputs, mainly nose-down inputs, applied during the go-around. These inputs were not consistent with what is expected in this flight phase. The degraded CRM did not make it possible for either crew member to identify and recover from the situation before the collision with the ground, even when the TAWS warnings were activated close to the ground. Based on elements from the investigation, the accident resulted from: - The lack of common action plan during the approach and a final approach continued below the MDA, without ground visual reference acquired. - The inappropriate application of flight control inputs during a go- around and on the activation of TAWS warnings, - The lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path.  These events can be explained by the following factors: - Limited CRM on approach that degraded during the missed approach. This degradation was probably amplified by numerous radio-communications during the final approach and the crews state of fatigue, - Aircraft control inputs typical in the occurrence of somatogravic perceptual illusions, - Inappropriate systematic analysis of flight data and feedback mechanism within the AFRIQIYAH Airways. - Non adherence to the company operation manual, SOP and standard terminology.  In addition, the investigation committee found the following as contributing factors to the accident: - Weather available to the crew did not reflect the actual weather situation in the final approach segment at Tripoli International Airport. - In adequacy of training received by the crew. - Occupancy of tower frequency by both air and ground movements control."

	   France",Take off,Test,Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS/LFBO),Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS/LFBO),"An Airbus A330-300 aircraft crashed during a test flight at the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France, killing all seven on board. The test flight was part of the preparation required to certify the autopilot, on this Airbus A330 equipped with Pratt and Whitney engines, to category III standards. The first part of the test flight was completed successfully when the aircraft landed on runway 15L. A 180 degree turn was made for takeoff from runway 33R.  The second takeoff was to be performed under conditions similar to those of the first takeoff. For this test however, the autopilot would incorporate the modification under study. The takeoff was performed by the co-pilot with TOGA (Takeoff Go Around) power instead of Flex 49, a lower power setting which was specified in the test procedure. Rotation was positive and pitch input was stopped when the attitude changed from 12 to 18 degrees nose-up. Within 5 seconds after takeoff several attempts to engage the autopilot were unsuccessful. After it was engaged, activation was delayed by two seconds because the first officer was exerting a slight nose down input on the side stick. The aircraft, still trimmed at 2.2 degrees nose-up, pitched up to reach 29 degrees and the speed had decreased to 145 knots. The captain meanwhile reduced thrust on the no. 1 engine to idle and cut off the hydraulic system in accordance with the flight test order. Immediately after it activated, the autopilot switched to altitude acquisition mode. The altitude had been set at 2000 feet on the previous flight phase. This caused the pitch attitude to increase to 32 degrees in an attempt to reach 2000 feet. The speed decreased further to 100 knots, whereas the minimum control speed is 118 kts. Roll control was lost and the captain reduced no. 2 engine thrust to idle to recover symmetry on the roll axis. Bank and pitch attitudes had reached 112 degrees left and -43 degrees resp. before the pilot managed to regain control. It was however too late to avoid ground impact at a pitch attitude of around -15 degrees.  PROBABLE CAUSES: ""At the present stage of its work, the commission estimates that the accident can be explained by a combination of several factors none of which, taken separately, would have led to an accident. The initial causes are primarily related to the type of the test and its execution by the crew during the last takeoff: 1) choice of maximum power (TOGA) instead of Flex 49;  2) very aft CG for the last takeoff;  3) trim set in the takeoff range, but in too high a nose-up position;  4) selected altitude of 2000 feet;  5) imprecise and late definition of the test to be conducted and the tasks to be performed by the captain and first officer, respectively;  6) positive and very rapid rotation executed by the first officer;  7) the captain was busy with the test operations to be performed immediately after take off (engagement of the autopilot, reduce thrust on the engine and cut off the blue hydraulic system) which temporarily placed him outside the control loop;  8) in addition the absence of pitch attitude protection in the autopilot altitude acquisition mode played a significant role.  The following is also contributed to the accident:  1) The inability of the crew to identify the mode in which the autopilot was placed;  2) the confidence of the crew in the expected reactions of the aircraft;  3) the late reaction from the flight test engineer when faced with a potentially hazardous change in parameters (speed in particular);  4) the time taken by the captain to react to an abnormal situation."""

The aircraft deviated to the north up to 47 km while descending from 8200 to 5200 m.  The visibility for an approach to runway 34 was less than that established for this approach pattern. At a distance of 45 km, a turn to the opposite course was started and the descent was continued to 3300 m.  After passing the airfield, the crew began the permitted descent from 3300 m, but did not complete a standard turn and left the approach pattern, continuing the flight towards the mountains up to 4100 m in the dark.

At 15:53:22, the flight contacted the Kennedy final vector controller, who continued to provide radar vectors around thunderstorms in the area, to sequence the flight with other traffic, and to position the flight on the localizer course. The flightcrew then discussed the problems associated with carrying minimum fuel loads when confronted with delays in terminal areas. One of the crewmembers stated that he was going to check the weather at the alternate airport, which was LaGuardia Airport (LGA). Less than a minute later, one of the crewmembers remarked, ""... one more hour and we'd come down whether we wanted to or not."" At 15:59:19, the final vector controller transmitted a message to all aircraft on his frequency that ""a severe wind shift"" had been reported on the final approach and that he would report more information shortly. Eastern Air Lines Flight 902, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, had abandoned its approach to runway 22L earlier.

While Eastern 902 was making this report, the captain of Eastern 66, said, ""You know this is asinine."" An unidentified crewmember responded, ""I wonder if they're covering for themselves."" The final vector controller asked Eastern 66 if they had heard Eastern 902's report. Eastern 66 replied, ""...affirmative."" The controller then established the flight's position as being 5 miles from the outer marker (OM) and cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 22L. Eastern 66 acknowledged the clearance at 16:00:54, ""Okay, we'll let you know about the conditions."" One minute later, the first officer, who was flying the aircraft, called for completion of the final checklist. While the final checklist items were being completed, the captain stated that the radar was, ""Up and off... standby."" At 16:02:20, the captain said, ""...I have the radar on standby in case I need it, I can get it off later."" At 16:02:42, the final vector controller asked Eastern 902, ""..would you classify that as severe wind shift, correction, shear?"" The flight responded, ""Affirmative.""

An unidentified crewmember said, ""I...would suggest that you do"" the first officer responded, ""In case he's right."" At 16:02:58, Eastern 66 reported over the OM, and the final vector controller cleared the flight to contact the Kennedy tower. The first officer requested 30° of flaps and the aircraft continued to bracket the glideslope with the airspeed oscillating between 140 and 145 knots. At 1603:12, the flight established communications with Kennedy tower local controller and reported that they were, ""outer marker, inbound."" The Kennedy tower local controller cleared Eastern 66 to land. The captain acknowledged the clearance and asked, ""Got any reports on braking action...?"" The local controller did not respond until the query was repeated. The local controller replied, ""No,none, approach end of runway is wet... but I'd say about the first half is wet--we've had no adverse reports."" At 1603:57.7, the flight engineer called, ""1000 feet"" and at 1604:25, the sound of rain was recorded. The flight was nearly centered on the glideslope when the flight engineer called, ""500 feet.""  The airspeed was oscillating between 140 and 148 knots and the sound of heavy rain could be heard as the aircraft descended below 500 feet. The windshield wipers were switched to high speed. At 16:04:40, the captain said, ""Stay on the gauges."" The first officer responded, ""Oh, yes. I'm right with it."" The flight engineer reported, ""Three greens, 30 degrees, final checklist,"" and the captain responded, ""Right."" At 16:04:52, the captain said, ""I have approach lights,"" and the first officer said, ""Okay."" The captain then again said, ""Stay on the gauges,"" and the first officer replied, ""I'm with it."" N8845E then was passing through 400 feet, and its rate of descent increased from an average of about 675 fpm to 1,500 fpm. The aircraft rapidly began to deviate below the glideslope, and 4 seconds later, the airspeed decreased from 138 kts to 123 kts in 2.5 seconds. The Boeing 727 continued to deviate further below the glideslope, and at 16:05:06.2, when the aircraft was at 150 feet, the captain said, ""runway in sight."" Less than a second later, the first officer said, ""I got it."" The captain replied, ""got it?"" and a second later, at 16:05:10, an unintelligible exclamation was recorded, and the first officer commanded, ""Takeoff thrust."" The airplane contacted the top of the No. 7 approach light tower at an elevation of 27 feet above the mean low-water level and 2,400 feet from the threshold of runway 22L. The aircraft continued and struck towers 8 and 9. The aircrafts left wing was damaged severely by impact with these towers--the outboard section was severed. The aircraft then rolled into a steep left bank, well in excess of 90°. It contacted the ground and the fuselage struck five other towers. The aircraft then continued to Rockaway Boulevard, where it came to rest. The approach light towers and large boulders along the latter portion of the path caused the fuselage to collapse and disintegrate. A fire had erupted after the left wing failed.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The aircraft's encounter with adverse winds associated with a very strong thunderstorm located astride the ILS localizer course, which resulted in  high descent rate into the non-frangible approach light towers. The flight crew's delayed recognition and correction of the high descent rate were probably associated with their reliance upon visual cues rather than on flight instrument reference. However, the adverse winds might have been too severe for a successful approach and landing even had they relied upon and responded rapidly to the indications of the flight instruments. Contributing to the accident was the continued use of runway 22L when it should have become evident to both air traffic control personnel and the flight crew that a  severe weather hazard existed along the approach path."""

Both aircraft caught fire and slid to the left into an unoccupied fire station.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the Los Angeles Air Traffic Facility Management to implement procedures that provided redundancy comparable to the requirements contained in the National Operational Position Standards and the failure of the FAA ATS to provide adequate policy direction and oversight to its ATC facility managers. These failures created an environment in the Los Angeles ATC tower that ultimately led to the failure of the Local Controller 2 (LC2) to maintain awareness of the traffic situation, culminating in the inappropriate clearances and the subsequent collision of the USAir and SkyWest aircraft. Contributing to the cause pf the accident was the failure of the FAA to provide effective quality assurance pf the ATC system."""

	   Indonesia",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII),Yogyakarta-Adisutjipto Airport (JOG/WARJ),"Garuda flight 200 was an early morning service from Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG). The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying, and the copilot was the support/monitoring pilot. The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. At 07:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. As the aircraft was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC to go around. The aircraft overran the departure end of runway 09, to the right of the centerline at 110 knots. The aircraft crossed a road, and impacted an embankment before stopping in a rice paddy field 252 meters from the threshold of runway 27 (departure end of runway 09). The aircraft destroyed by the impact forces and an intense, fuel-fed, post-impact fire.  CAUSES:  ""1. Flight crew communication and coordination was less than effective after the aircraft passed 2,336 feet on descent after flap 1 was selected. Therefore the safety of the flight was compromized.  2. The PIC flew the aircraft at an excessively high airspeed and steep descent during the approach. The crew did not abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. 3. The pilot in command did not act on the 15 GPWS alerts and warnings, and the two calls from the copilot to go around. 4. The copilot did not follow company instructions and take control of the aircraft from the pilot in command when he saw that the pilot in command repeatedly ignored warnings to go around. 5. Garuda did not provide simulator training for its Boeing 737 flight crews covering vital actions and required responses to GPWS and EGPWS alerts and warnings such as TOO LOW TERRAIN and WHOOP, WHOOP PULL UP."""
Sunday 17 November 2013,19:23,Boeing 737-53A,Tatarstan Airlines,51547,50,"Kazan International Airport (KZN) - 
	   Russia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD),Kazan International Airport (KZN/UWKD),"A Boeing 737-53A passenger plane, operated by Tatarstan Airlines, was destroyed in an accident at Kazan Airport (KZN), Russia. All 44 passengers and six crew members were killed. Flight 363 departed from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport (DME) at 18:20 local time on a scheduled service to Kazan (KZN).  En route the crew noted that their navigation system's map was displaced. During the descent towards Kazan did not ask for vectors from air traffic control and continued their approach, which was flown 4 km to the north of the published approach procedure due to the map displacement issue. After turning to final for runway 29 the aircraft was not able to capture the localizer. The flight crew programmed a heading of 250° in the HDG SEL (Heading Select mode) of the autopilot and hurriedly configured the aircraft for landing. The approach was unstabilized and as the aircraft turned towards runway heading the copilot noticed the PAPI lights and saw they were too high. He initiated a go around. At that time the aircraft was at 270m (900 ft) and configured for landing with gear down, 30° flaps. The autopilot was in ALT HOLD mode with altitude programmed at 270 m. The use of the TO/GA switch caused the autopilot to be switched off. The flaps were raised to 15°, but no manual control inputs were made.  The increase in engine power and retracting the flaps caused a pitch-up of the airplane with the pitch angle reaching a value of about to 25°. Indicated airspeed began to decrease, the stabilizer automatically trimmed nose down.  All the time the copilot was engaged in radio communications with the Kazan Tower controller. Subsequently the copilot reminded the captain to raise the undercarriage.  With the pitch angle exceeding 25° the crew began using the control column to reduce the pitch angle. At this point, the aircraft was at an altitude of about 600 meters (2,000 feet), and continued to climb with a vertical speed of 20 m/s. Due to nose down input by the captain and trim system, the pitch angle decreased quickly. Vertical loads decreased to 0,5 g as the aircraft had reached the top of climbing at 2300 feet / 700 meters. Indicated airspeed had decreased to its minimum value of 117 knots.  Vertical loads then decreased to about 0 g, with a negative pitch angle reaching 20°. The aircraft descended at a rate of more than 5000 ft/min (25 m/s).  The EGPWS gave ""sink rate"" and ""pull up"" warnings as the aircraft pitch angle reached -60° with a load of -0.9 g. The aircraft collided with the ground at high speed, over 450 km/h, and a large negative pitch angle of about 75°. From the beginning of the missed approach until the collision with terrain, 45 seconds passed. The aircraft impacted the ground between the runway and the main taxiway about 1850 m past the runway 29 threshold.  Investigation revealed that the captain received training to become a Boeing 737 captain after serving as a navigator between 1991 and 2010. The copilot used to be a flight engineer (1989 to 2008) and was also trained to become a Boeing 737 pilot. The captain had a very limited knowledge of English, which was considered insufficient to comprehend English language training documents and manuals. As the oversight of the training facility was poor, shortcomings in training were not noticed. Training and safety management within Tatarstan Airlines was considered equally poor.  PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Russian): The cause of the crash Boeing 737-500 VQ-BBN were systemic deficiencies in the identification of hazards and risk control, as well as a non-functional safety management system in the airline and the lack of control over the level of training of the crew members from the aviation authorities at all levels (Tatar MTU BT, Federal Air Transport Agency), which led to the admission of an unprepared flight crew. When the missed approach was executed the crew did not recognize the fact that the autopilot was off and the aircraft pitched up to a complex spatial position (Nose up Upset). The PIC's (pilot flying) lack of flying skills in complex spatial positions (Upset Recovery) led to the creation of a large negative overload, loss of spatial orientation and transfer of the aircraft into a steep dive (pitch down to 75°) until the impact with the ground. The need for a go-around was caused by the position of the aircraft relative to the runway, which was the result of ""a map shift"" effect (Map shift, an error in the determination of the aircraft position by onboard systems) by about 4 km, the crew's inability in the circumstances to integrated piloting and maintenance of navigation with the required accuracy, and the lack of active assistance of the air traffic control service under the long-term monitoring of significant deviations from the approach procedure."
Friday 28 September 2018,10:10,Boeing 737-8BK (WL),Air Niugini,37160,1,"0,5 km from Chuuk/Weno International Airport (TKK) - 
	   Micronesia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Pohnpei Airport (PNI/PTPN),Chuuk/Weno International Airport (TKK/PTKK),"A Boeing 737-800 operated by Air Niugini as flight 73 impacted the water of Chuuk Lagoon about 1,500 ft (460 m) short of the runway 04 threshold, during its approach Chuuk International Airport, Micronesia. The aircraft took off from Pohnpei at 22:22 on a flight to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea via Chuuk. The PIC was the pilot flying for the sector to Chuuk. The copilot was the monitoring pilot. The engineer for the flight was seated in the cockpit jump seat during the approach.  Prior to top of descent the crew briefly discussed brake setting for the landing and discussed the approach and landing flap setting. They agreed to select Flap 40. They then discussed the approach and missed approach procedure they would conduct at HAMAX if they found themselves not visual by that point. However, the approach and landing checklist and the briefing on the RNAV approach chart briefings were not conducted in accordance with the SOPs and not using standard phraseology.  At top of descent, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were already high and needed to immediately initiate their descent. The crew commenced their descent leaving FL400 at 22:56, at a descent rate of 944 ft/pm. At FL340, the copilot contacted San Francisco radio and reported that they were maintaining FL340. Both pilots discussed the descent clearance for about two minutes, trying to recall and clarify the instructions that they were given. At 23:05, while maintaining FL340, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were high on profile and needed to descend to get back on the required descent profile. At 23:08, the PIC said ""alright, we catching back on profile, so just keep the speed up"". The copilot contacted Chuuk radio at 23:08 and requested a weather update. At 23:11, Chuuk radio contacted the crew with the weather update for Chuuk stating: ""wind variable at 5, visibility 14 scattered 012 charlie bravo, broken 120 overcast 280, temperature 26 dep point 25, altimeter 2973"". At 23:15, at about 15 nm from Chuuk while passing 8,600 ft, the copilot made an inbound broadcast call stating their intention to track for the RNAV (GPS) runway 04, from the east south-east. Five minutes later the copilot made a general broadcast, stating that they were established on 041 inbound via the RNAV (GPS) runway 04. The aircraft was then configured for the approach. At 1000 feet the aircraft was stable but above the 3 degrees glidepath. At 23:23 the PIC disconnected the auto-pilot and stated: ""Im going back on profile."" When passing 548 ft (602 ft Radio Altitude) on descent, the aircraft entered the storm cell and heavy rain and the PIC called for the wipers to be switched on.  After passing the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA), between 307 ft (364 ft RA) fourteen 'Sink Rate' and 'Glideslope' aural alerts began to sound. The flight crew disregarded the alerts, and did not acknowledge the ""minimums"" and 100 ft alerts. After descending through 100 feet the copilot noticed they were dangerously low and called rapidly with high intonation: ""Too low! Were too low! Were too low! Were too low!"" The aircraft then skipped across the water several times before it settled in the water and turned clockwise through 210 deg and drifted 460 ft (140 m) south east of the runway 04 extended centreline, with the nose of the aircraft pointing about 265 degrees. Local boaters rescued 28 passengers and two cabin crew from the left over-wing exits. Two cabin crew, the two pilots and the engineer were rescued by local boaters from the forward door 1L. One life raft was launched from the left aft over-wing exit by cabin crew CC5 with the assistance of a passenger. The US Navy divers rescued six passengers and four cabin crew and the Load Master from the right aft over-wing exit. All injured passengers were evacuated from the left over-wing exits. One passenger was fatally injured, and local divers located his body in the aircraft three days after the accident.  The accident investigators concluded that both pilots were not situationally aware during the approach and did not recognise the developing significant unsafe condition after passing the Missed Approach Point (MAP) when the aircraft entered a storm cell and heavy rain. The weather radar on the PICs Navigation Display showed a large red area indicating a storm cell immediately after the MAP, between the MAP and the runway. The copilot as the monitoring pilot was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. He did not recognise the significant unsafe condition and therefore did not realise the need to challenge the PIC and take control of the aircraft, as required by the Air Niugini SOP. Training records showed that the copilot had been checked in the simulator for EGPWS Alert (Terrain) however there was no evidence of simulator check sessions covering the vital actions and responses required to retrieve a perceived or real situation that might compromise the safe operation of the aircraft. Specifically sustained unstabilised approach below 1,000 ft amsl in IMC as in the case of the accident. The PIC did not conduct the missed approach at the MAP despite the criteria required for visually continuing the approach not being met, including visually acquiring the runway or the PAPI. The PIC did not conduct a go around after passing the MAP and subsequently the MDA although: the aircraft had entered IMC; the approach was unstable; the glideslope indicator on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) was showing a rapid glideslope deviation from a half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the rate of descent was high (more than 1,000 ft/min) and increasing; there were EGPWS Sink Rate and Glideslope aural alerts; and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning message was displayed on the PFD.  CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS]: The flight crew did not comply with Air Niugini Standard Operating Procedures Manual (SOPM) and the approach and pre-landing checklists. The RNAV (GPS) Rwy 04 Approach chart procedure was not adequately briefed. The aircrafts flight path became unstable with lateral over-controlling commencing shortly after autopilot disconnect at 625 ft (677 ft). From 546 ft (600 ft) the aircraft was flown in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the rate of descent significantly exceeded 1,000 feet/min in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) from 420 ft (477 ft). The flight crew heard, but disregarded, 13 EGPWS aural alerts (Glideslope and Sink Rate), and flew a 4.5º average flight path (glideslope). The pilots lost situational awareness and their attention was channelised or fixated on completing the landing. The PIC did not execute the missed approach at the MAP despite: PAPI showing 3 whites just before entering IMC; the unstabilised approach; the glideslope indicator on the PFD showing a rapid glideslope deviation from half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the excessive rate of descent; the EGPWS aural alerts: and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning on the PFD. The copilot (support/monitoring pilot) was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. It is likely that a continuous ""WHOOP WHOOP PULL UP"" hard aural warning, simultaneously with the visual display of PULL UP on the PFD (desirably a flashing visual display PULL UP on the PFD), could have been effective in alerting the crew of the imminent danger, prompting a pull up and execution of a missed approach, that may have prevented the accident."

	   India",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Bombay-Santacruz Airport (BOM/VABB),Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB),"New year's day 1978. It's 20:12 when Air-India flight 855 departs Bombay Airport's runway 27 for a flight to Dubai. The Boeing 747-200, named ""Emperor Ashoka"", was cleared to climb to 8000 feet and report leaving 2400 feet. Approx. one minute after takeoff the plane enters a gentle right turn heading for the Arabian Sea. The Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) however remained in a right-bank indication, while the wings were already level. The captain then said: ""What's happened here, my instrument..."". The co-pilot didn't note the captain's concern and replied: ""Mine has also toppled, look's fine."" The flight engineer however noticed the difference between the captain's ADI and the third spare ADI. Because it was dark outside and the aircraft was over the Arabian Sea, there was no visual contact with the horizon. The captain continued to roll to the left because, looking at his ADI, he still thinks the plane is in a right bank. As the airplane rolled through 40 degrees left, the flight engineer indicated to the captain: ""Don't go by that one, don't go by that one..."". The plane however continued to roll to the left, to 108 degrees left bank. The 747 started to descend from approx. 2000 feet altitude until it crashed into shallow (10 m deep) water, 3 km offshore in an approx. 35-40 degree nose down pitch.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The probable cause of this accident was due to the irrational control wheel inputs given by the captain following complete unawareness of the attitude of the aircraft on his part after Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) had malfunctioned. The crew failed to gain control based on the other flight instruments. He had failed to determine the attitude of the aircraft with the associated flight instruments including Standby Horizon Indicator. The co-pilot had failed to monitor the flight instruments and did not render any assistance to the captain in ascertaining the attitude of the aircraft."

While flying over Burkina Faso, at FL350, on 5th september at 00h22 UTC, the aircraft encountered severe turbulence. 30 people were injured in the incident. 1 of the injured people died on September 22.  9 other occupants were heavily injured but survived, while the other 20 received only minor injuries. The plane landed safely at Marseille airport. The aircraft was substantially damaged in this accident.   PROBABLE CAUSE: The accident was due to crossing an area where the aircraft experienced a strong storm with extreme turbulence. The following factors are the cause of this situation: - Despite repetitive intermittent faults, the weather radar had not been repaired; - The flight was  undertaken  on the basis of  insufficient and misinterpreted meteorological information; - The crew did not consider the non-operation of airborne radar and continued the flight while weather conditions were noticeably deteriorating. An aggravating factor for the consequences of the accident is that many passengers had detached or loosened their belt despite the set on. Another contributing factor appears to be the fall of a video monitor. This last factor is related to the overall qualification on the aircraft cabin design, without prior dynamic tests."
Tuesday 6 February 1996,23:47,Boeing 757-225,"Alas Nacionales, lsf Birgenair",29269,189,"26 km NE off Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic - 
	   Atlantic Ocean",En route,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Puerto Plata-La Union International Airport (POP/MDPP),"Gander Airport, NL (YQX/CYQX)","Alas Nacionales flight 301 departed Puerto Plata for a charter flight to Frankfurt via Gander and Berlin at 23:42 LT. At 80 knots on takeoff the captain found out that his air speed indicator (ASI) wasn't working properly. The co-pilot's indicator seemed to work fine. While climbing through 4700 feet the captain's ASI read 350 knots (real speed was about 220 kts); this resulted in an autopilot/autothrottle reaction to increase the pitch-up attitude and a power reduction in order to lower the airspeed. At that time the crew got 'Rudder ratio' and 'Mach airspeed' advisory warnings. Both pilots got confused when the co-pilot stated that his ASI read 200 knots decreasing while getting an excessive speed-warning, followed by a stick shaker warning. This led the pilots to believe that both ASIs were unreliable.  Finally realizing that they were losing speed and altitude they disconnected the autopilot. The autopilot, fed by the captain's faulty ASI, had reduced the speed close to the stall speed. Full thrust was then applied. At 23:47:17 an aural GPWS warning sounded. Eight seconds later the aircraft struck the ocean. The incorrect ASI readings were probably caused by the obstruction of the pitot system by mud and/or debris from a small insect that was introduced in the pitot tube during the time the aircraft was on the ground. The aircraft was not flown for 20 days before the crash and was returned for service without a verification of the pitot-static system as recommended by Boeing.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The crew's failure to recognize the activation of the stick shaker as a warning of imminent entrance to the stall, and the failure of the crew to execute the procedures for recovery from the onset of loss of control."""

	   South Korea",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Beijing-Capital International Airport (PEK/ZBAA),Busan-Gimhae (Pusan) International Airport (PUS/RKPK),"Air China flight 129 departed Beijing at 08:37 on a scheduled flight to Pusan-Gimhae in South Korea. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 11:06 the second officer contacted Gimhae Approach. At that moment the airplane was 32 nm from the airport at an altitude of FL170. The approach controller cleared the flight to descend to 6000 feet. Runway 36L was in use and the crew could expect a straight-in approach. at 11:09 the controller notified the crew that the runway was changed to 18R, with winds 210 degrees at 17 kts. This meant a circling approach which none of the crew members had flown yet at Pusan. The captain and first officer then discussed the approach to be flown. The captain cautioned: ""We won't enlarge the traffic pattern, the mountains are all over that side."" At 11:13 the flight was further cleared down to 2600 feet. Two minutes later the approach controller radioed: ""Air China 129, turn left heading 030 cleared for ILS DME runway 36L, then circle to runway 18 right, report field in sight."" At 11:17 they captured the ILS and were cleared further down to the circling altitude of 700 feet. The landing gear was extended and flaps set at 20 degrees. Then the controller instructed the flight to contact Gimhae Tower and to circle west. The second officer responded but did not read back the frequency change. The captain then instructed the first officer to disconnect the autopilot and turn left. From his position in the right hand seat the first officer was able to observe the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam the runway the autopilot was reengaged with heading select. At that moment the approach controller again contacted flight 129 instructing them to contact the tower. The crew were busy looking outside to see when they passed abeam the end of the runway. Simultaneously the Gimhae Tower controller contacted the flight using the emergency frequency. As they passed abeam the threshold at 11:20:02 they started timing to measure the commencement f turning to base. Eleven seconds after the call on the emergency frequency, the second officer reported to the Tower controller that they were on the circle approach. At 11:20:17 the captain took over control from the first officer and said he was going to turn base. He slowly began a widening turn, causing the first officer to urge him: ""turn quickly, not too late."" Meanwhile the flight was cleared to land . At 11:20:32 the captain disconnected the autopilot and banked the plane to the right. Twenty-two seconds later the first officer cautioned: ""Pay attention to the altitude keeping,"" and the captain asked him to help him get a visual on the runway. Due to the limited visibility they were not able to see the runway. The first officer then advised the captain to initiate a go around, but the captain did not respond. At 11:21:15 the first officer said, ""Pull up! Pull up!"" Pitch attitude was increased to 11.4 degrees but thrust was not increased. Two seconds later the aircraft impacted a mountain, about 4.6 km from the runway.  FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES: 1. The flight crew of flight 129 performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air Chinas operations and training manuals. 2. The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captains intention to make a timely base turn. 3. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. 4. When the first officer advised the captain to execute a missed approach about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself."

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)",Cairo International Airport (CAI/HECA),"EgyptAir Flight 990 departed Los Angeles International Airport, destined for Cairo, with a scheduled intermediate stop at New York-JFK. The aircraft landed at JFK about 23:48 EDT and arrived at the gate about 00:10 EDT. Two designated flight crews (each crew consisting of a captain and first officer) boarded the aircraft at JFK. The aircraft taxied to runway 22R and was cleared for takeoff at 01:19. Shortly after liftoff, the pilots of EgyptAir flight 990 contacted New York Terminal Radar Approach (and departure) Control (TRACON). New York TRACON issued a series of climb instructions and, at 01:26, instructed the flight to climb to FL230 and contact New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). At 01:35, New York ARTCC instructed EgyptAir flight 990 to climb to FL330 and proceed directly to DOVEY intersection.  About 01:40 the relief first officer suggested that he relieve the command first officer at the controls. The command first officer agreed and left the flightdeck. The airplane leveled at FL330 four minutes later. At 01:48, the command captain decided to go to the toilet and left the flightdeck. At 01:48:30, about 11 seconds after the captain left the cockpit, the CVR recorded an unintelligible comment. Ten seconds later, the relief first officer stated quietly, ""I rely on God."" There were no sounds or events recorded by the flight recorders that would indicate that an airplane anomaly or other unusual circumstance preceded the relief first officer's statement. At 01:49:18, the CVR recorded the sound of an electric seat motor and 27 seconds later the autopilot was disconnected. At 01:49:48, the relief first officer again stated quietly, ""I rely on God."" At 01:49:53, the throttle levers were moved from their cruise power setting to idle, and, one second later, the FDR recorded an abrupt nose-down elevator movement and a very slight movement of the inboard ailerons. Subsequently, the airplane began to rapidly pitch nose down and descend. Between 0149:57 and 0150:05, the relief first officer quietly repeated, ""I rely on God,"" seven additional times. During this time, as a result of the nose-down elevator movement, the airplane's load factor decreased from about 1 to about 0.2 G (almost weightlessness). Then the elevators started moving further in the nose-down direction. Immediately thereafter the captain entered the flightdeck and asked loudly, ""What's happening? What's happening?"". As he airplane's load factor reached negative G loads (about -0.2 G) the relief first officer stated for the tenth time, ""I rely on God."" At 01:50:08, as the airplane exceeded its maximum operating airspeed (0.86 Mach), a master warning alarm began to sound and the relief first officer stated quietly for the eleventh and final time, ""I rely on God,"" and the captain repeated his question, ""What's happening?"" At 0150:15, as the airplane was descending through about 27,300 feet the airplane's rate of descent began to decrease. About 6 seconds later the left and right elevator surfaces began to move in opposite directions. The engine start lever switches for both engines then moved from the run to the cutoff position. At 01:50:24 the throttle levers started to move from their idle position to full throttle, and the speedbrake handle moved to its fully deployed position. The captain again asked ""What is this? What is this? Did you shut the engine(s)?"" At 01:50:26, the captain stated, ""Get away in the engines ... shut the engines"". The relief first officer replied ""It's shut"". Between 01:50:31 and 01:50:37, the captain repeatedly stated, ""Pull with me."" However, the elevator surfaces remained in a split condition (with the left surface commanding nose up and the right surface commanding nose down) until the FDR and CVR stopped recording. at 0150:36.64 and 0150:38.47, respectively. The height estimates based on primary radar data from the joint use FAA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) radar sites indicated that the airplane's descent stopped about 01:50:38 and that the airplane subsequently climbed to about 25,000 feet msl and changed heading from 80º to 140º before it started a second descent, which continued until the airplane impacted the ocean.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the EgyptAir flight 990 accident is the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs. The reason for the relief first officer's actions was not determined."""

	   Ukraine",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM),Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK),"A Boeing 777-200 passenger plane, operating Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, was destroyed in an accident in eastern Ukraine, near Hrabove. All 298 on board were killed. Flight MH17 departed the gate at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands at 12:13 hours local time, bound for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was airborne at 12:31 (10:31 UTC) from runway 36C and reached a cruising altitude of FL310 at 12:53 (10:53 UTC). Ninety minutes into the flight, at 12:01 UTC and just prior to entering Ukrainian airspace, the flight climbed to FL330.  According to the flight plan, flight MH17 would continue at the flight level until the waypoint PEKIT, which is on the Flight Information Region (FIR) boundary between Kiev FIR (UKBV) and Dnipropetrovsk FIR (UKDV). From waypoint PEKIT the flight plan indicates a climb to FL350 on airway L980 for the remaining part over Ukraine. According to ATC data, at 12:53 UTC the aircraft was flying within the Dnipropetrovsk FIR, Control Sector 2, at FL330, controlled by Dnipro Control. At that time, Dnipro Control asked whether MH17 was able to climb to FL350 in accordance with the flight plan and also to clear a potential separation conflict with other traffic in the area. This traffic was Singapore Airlines flight SQ351 from Copenhagen, a Boeing 777, flying at FL330 and approaching from behind. The crew replied they were unable to comply and requested to maintain at FL330. This was agreed by Dnipro Control. As an alternative to solve the separation conflict, the other traffic climbed to FL350. According to ATC data, at 13:00 UTC the crew of flight MH17 requested to divert the track 20 NM to the left, due to weather. This also was agreed by Dnipro Control, after which the crew requested whether FL340 was available. Dnipro control informed MH17 that FL340 was not available at that moment and instructed the flight to maintain FL330 for a while. At 13:07 UTC the flight was transferred to Dnipropetrovsk CTA 4, also with call sign Dnipro Control. At 13:19:53 UTC, radar data showed that the aircraft was 3.6 NM north of centreline of airway L980 having deviated left of track, when Dnipro Control directed the crew to alter their route directly to waypoint RND due to other traffic. The crew acknowledged at 13:19:56 hrs. At 13.20:00 hrs, Dnipro Control transmitted an onward ATC clearance to ""proceed direct to TIKNA after RND"", no acknowledgement was received. Data from the Flight Data Recorder and the Digital Cockpit Voice Recorder both stopped at 13:20:03 hrs. No distress messages were received from the aircraft.  The airplane apparently broke up in mid-air as debris was found in a large area. The centre section of the fuselage along with parts of the horizontal and vertical stabilizers was found near Hrabove. The cockpit and lower nose section came down in a sunflower field in Rozsypne, nearly four miles (6,5 km) west-southwest of Hrabove. The L2 and R2 doors along with various parts of the fuselage were found near Petropavlivka, about 5 miles (8 km) west of Hrabove.  At the point of last contact it was flying 1000 feet above airspace that had been classified as restricted by Ukrainian authorities as a result of ongoing fighting in the area. In the preceding days before the accident two Ukraine Air Force aircraft that were shot down in the region: a Su-25 and an An-26 transport plane.  Causes of the crash: a. On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines operated flight MH17, an airworthy Boeing 777-200 with the registration 9M-MRD, in cruise flight near the Ukrainian/Russian border at 33,000 feet, under the control of Ukrainian Air Traffic Control and was operated by a competent and qualified crew. b. At 13.20:03 hours (15.20:03 CET) a warhead detonated outside and above the left hand side of the cockpit of flight MH17. It was a 9N314M warhead carried on the 9M38-series of missiles as installed on the Buk surface-to-air missile system. c. Other scenarios that could have led to the disintegration of the aeroplane were considered, analysed and excluded based on the evidence available. d. The impact killed the three persons in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the forward part of the aeroplane leading to an in-flight break-up. The break-up resulted in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres between the village of Petropavlivka and the town of Hrabove, Ukraine. All 298 occupants lost their lives."
Tuesday 10 October 2006,07:32,British Aerospace BAe-146-200A,Atlantic Airways,39828,4,"Stord-Sørstokken Airport (SRP) - 
	   Norway",Landing,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Stavanger-Sola Airport (SVG/ENZV),Stord-Sørstokken Airport (SRP/ENSO),"Atlantic Airways Flight RC670 was chartered by the Norwegian industrial concern Aker Kværner to fly personnel from Stavanger (SVG) to Molde (MOL) via Stord (SRP). The airplane departed Stavanger at 07:17 and positioned for an approach to runway 33 at Stord around 07:30.  Before OY-CRG started its approach, the airport performed a routine runway inspection. The runway report did not contain information with regard to whether the runway was dry, damp or wet. Because the crew were not informed otherwise, they assumed that the runway was dry. However, investigations by the AIBN have revealed that the runway was in fact damp.  A corresponding aircraft had performed a normal landing towards the south (runway 15) 15 minutes earlier. The crew of OY-CRG were given a wind reading of 120° at 6 knots. They had visual contact with the airport at an early stage and decided to carry out a visual approach northwards (runway 33).  Upon landing the pilots noted that the aircraft's lift spoilers did not deploy. The indicator lights that normally light up after 3 seconds did not do so. The pilots immediately called ""No spoilers"". Thereafter the pilots experienced that the maximum application of the brakes did not lead to the expected deceleration. The alternative braking system was brought into use and then finally the emergency brakes, without this making any difference.  The emergency brakes do not have anti-skid protection and the wheels locked, so that in combination with the damp runway reverted rubber hydroplaning occurred. Consequently the friction against the runway was significantly reduced. The commander had a certain directional control of the aircraft and wanted to avoid leaving the runway at places where he knew that the terrain was particularly unfavourable. The aircraft left the runway end to the north at a relatively low speed of 15-20 knots. It continued down a steep slope and the aircraft sustained significant damage as it crashed into lighting poles, trees and large rocks.  When the aircraft came to rest, it was not possible to stop the left inner engine (no. 2) due to the damage. It continued to operate at a high rpm for several minutes. The forward left emergency exit could not be opened due to damage to the fuselage that had jammed the door. The forward right emergency exit was blocked by the terrain outside. The commander made several attempts to open and release the cockpit door without success. The cabin roof had sustained a large rift which resulted in fuel from the wings entering the cabin. A fire on the aircrafts right side spread into the cabin and over to the aircrafts left side. Three passengers and the forward cabin crew member were killed. The remaining nine passengers and the rear cabin crew member managed to evacuate the aircraft from the aircrafts rear left emergency exit by jumping to the ground and passing the engine that was still running. Six people sustained serious burns.   According to the manufacturers approved documentation, it is to be expected that the landing distance would increase by 40% if all lift spoilers were inoperative. The AIBN has calculated that under the prevailing conditions OY-CRG should have stopped around 100 metres before the end of the runway. The aircrafts undercarriage has been thoroughly examined by the AIBN. A number of fragments of ""boiled"" rubber were found on the runway. Further, a tyre showed clear indications of so-called ""rubber reversal"" which occurs when a cushion of steam forms and the rubber is ""boiled"" under the tyres.  The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13. It was amongst others concluded that none of the aircraft's six lift spoilers were deployed when the commander operated the spoiler lever. The AIBN has found two possible explanations for the spoilers not being deployed: 1. A mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism. 2. Faults in two of the four thrust lever micro switches. A fault in one switch may have been hidden right up until a further switch failed. The AIBN reports that the runway at Stord was not grooved and it believes that reverted rubber hydroplaning will not occur, or will be significantly reduced, on grooved runways."

	   Congo (Democratic Republic)",Landing,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Kisangani-Bangoka International Airport (FKI/FZIC),Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH/FZAA),"A CRJ-100ER passenger plane, operating on a United Nations flight, was destroyed in an accident at Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH), Democratic Republic of the Congo. The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident. The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI).  The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 12:18. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg. At 13:31, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 13:55 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG. At 13:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 13:49, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH. At 13:50, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 13:53 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24. While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24. As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold. At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed. While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down.  Probable cause of the Accident:  The most probable cause of the accident was the aircraft's encounter with a severe Microburst like weather phenomenon at a very low altitude during the process of Go Around. The severe vertical gust/downdraft caused a significant and sudden pitch change to the aircraft which resulted in a considerable loss of height. Being at very low altitude, recovery from such a disturbance was not possible. The possibility of a somatogravic illusion caused Loss Of Control (LOC) as the primary cause of the accident, was also discussed by the investigation team. This was ruled out based on available evidence which showed that during the Go Around, the crew had initiated the climb at 1256 32 and had thereafter, maintained a climbing attitude for the next 12 seconds. At 1256 44, the aircraft experienced a sudden and steep nose down attitude change without a corresponding control input by the crew (as shown by FDR), Hence, Somatogravic Illusion caused Loss of Control was ruled out as a cause of accident.  Probable contributing factors: 1. The inappropriate decision of the crew to continue the approach, in face of extremely inclement weather being displayed on their weather radar, was probably the principle contributing factor responsible for the accident. 2. Lack of adequate supervision by the Operator to ensure that its crew complied with established procedures including weather avoidance procedures and Stabilized Approach criteria, was a probable contributing factor. 3. Inadequacy of Georgian Airways Training program for upgrade to Captain was a probable contributing Factor. 4. Lack of effective oversight of Georgian Airways by Georgian CAA was a probable contributing factor. 5. Lack of appropriate equipment at Kinshasa airport for identification and tracking of adverse weather phenomenon, resulting in failure by ATC to provide appropriate early warning to the aircraft, was probably a contributing factor. 6. ATC not declaring the airfield closed when visibility dropped below Minima was a probable contributory factor."
Tuesday 29 January 2013,13:10,Canadair CL-600-2B19 Regional Jet CRJ-200ER,SCAT,25707,21,"1,6 km NE of Almaty Airport (ALA) - 
	   Kazakhstan",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Kokshetau Airport (KOV/UACK),Almaty Airport (ALA/UAAA),"A Canadair CRJ-200 operated by SCAT was destroyed in an accident near Almaty Airport (ALA), Kazakhstan, killing all 16 passengers and five crew members. Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA). Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying. At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area. This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain. At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground. A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20° pitch angle and broke up.  CONCLUSION: (translated from Russian): The accident with aircraft CRJ-200 UP-CJ006 occurred during the execution of a go-around, in instrument meteorological conditions, without the possibility of visual contact with ground reference points (vertical visibility in the fog did not exceed 40 m), the necessity of which was caused by the mismatch between the actual weather conditions and the minimum conditions for which the crew was certified to land. As a result, the deflection of the elevator towards a dive of the aircraft caused a descent and collision with the ground. It was not possible to uniquely identify the causes of the aircraft's transfer to a dive from the available data. The Commission did not find evidence of failures of aviation equipment, as well as external to the aircraft (icing, wind shear, wake turbulence) when trying to perform a go-around.  The most likely factors that led to the accident, were:   - partial loss performance of the pilot in command, which at the time of aircraft impact with the ground was not in a working position;   - the lack of CRM levels in the crew, and violation of the Fly-Navigate-Communicate principle, which manifested itself in diverting attention by the co-pilot to conduct external radio communication and lack of control of the flight instrument parameters;   - the lack of response to the EGPWS and the actions required;   - the impact somatographic illusions of perception of the pitch angle (a nose-up illusion);   - increased emotional stress by the crew members associated with the unjustified expectations of improved weather conditions at the time of landing;   - failure to comply with the requirements for health examination of flight personnel, which led to the pilot in command flying without the rehabilitation period and without assessment of his health status after undergoing surgery."

The flight departed Maputo at 11:26 local time (09:26 UTC) and was scheduled to land at Luanda at 14:10 local time (13:10 UTC). The airplane proceeded over Botswana at FL380 and was in contact with Gaborone ACC. At the EXEDU waypoint, about 13:09 local time (11:09 UTC), the aircraft commenced a sudden descent, which continued until the airplane impacted the ground at 11:16:26 UTC. Minutes before the crash the co-pilot left the cockpit for the lavatory. The captain then manually changed the altitude preselector from 38,000 feet to an altitude of 4,288 feet. This was changed to 1,888 feet and then to 592 feet. The auto throttle was manually reengaged and throttle lever then automatically retarded and set to idle. The airspeed was manually selected several times until the end of the recording, which remained close to the Vmo (maximum operating limit speed). During the descent the captain used the speed brake handle to activate the spoilers.  On the cockpit voice recorder sounds were heard of someone pounding on the cockpit door.  It was discovered that the captain went through numerous life experiences ranging from uncompleted divorce process, the suspected suicide of his son on November 21, 2012 and a recent heart surgery of his youngest daughter.  Probable Cause: The inputs to the auto flight systems by the person believed to be the Captain, who remained alone on the flight deck when the person believed to be the co-pilot requested to go to the lavatory, caused the aircraft to departure from cruise flight to a sustained controlled descent and subsequent collision with the terrain. Contributing factors: The non-compliance to company procedures that resulted in a sole crew member occupying the flight compartment."

Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar airplane, departed Fort Lauderdale on an IFR flight plan with 152 passengers and a crew of 11 on board at 15:10 EDT. The DFW Airport terminal weather forecast contained in the flightcrew's dispatch document package stated, in part, that there was a possibility of widely scattered rain showers and thunderstorms, becoming isolated after 20:00 CDT.  The flight was uneventful until passing New Orleans, Louisiana. A line of weather along the Texas-Louisiana gulf coast had intensified. The flightcrew elected to change their route of flight to the more northerly Blue Ridge arrival route to avoid the developing weather to the south. This change necessitated a 10 to 15-minute hold at the Texarkana, Arkansas, VORTAC for arrival sequencing at the DFW Airport. At 17:35, the flightcrew received the following ATIS broadcast: ""DFW arrival information romeo, two one four seven Greenwich, weather six thousand scattered, two one thousand scattered, visibility one zero, temperature one zero one, dew point six seven, wind calm, altimeter two niner niner two, runway one eight right one seven left, visual approaches in progress, advise approach control that you have romeo"".

The captain replied that he was looking at a ""pretty good size"" weather cell, ""at a heading of two five five ... and I'd rather not go through it, I'd rather go around it one way or the other."" Fort Worth ARTCC then gave the flight another heading and stated ""when I can I'll turn you into Blue Ridge, it'll be about the zero one zero radial.""  At 17:46, the center cleared flight 191 direct to Blue Ridge and to descend to 9,000 feet, and flight 191 acknowledged receipt of the clearance. At 17:48, the captain told the first officer, ""You're in good shape. I'm glad we didn't have to go through that mess. I thought sure he was going to send us through it."" Three minutes later, the flight engineer said, ""Looks like it's raining over Fort Worth.""  At 17:51, Forth Worth ARTCC instructed flight 191 to contact DFW Airport Approach Control. At 17:56:28, Regional Approach Control's Feeder East controller transmitted an all aircraft message which was received by flight 191. The message stated in part, ""Attention, all aircraft listening... there's a little rainshower just north of the airport and they're starting to make ILS approaches ... tune up one oh nine one for one seven left."" At 17:59, the first officer stated, ""We're gonna get our airplane washed,"" and the captain switched to Regional Approach Control's Arrival Radar-1 (AR-1) frequency and told the controller that they were at 5,000 feet. At 18:00, the approach controller asked American Air Lines flight 351 if it was able to see the airport. (Flight 351 was two airplanes ahead of flight 191 in the landing sequence for runway 17L.) Flight 351 replied, ""As soon as we break out of this rainshower we will."" The controller then told flight 351 that it was 4 miles from the outer marker, and to join the localizer at 2,300 feet; the controller then cleared the flight for the ILS approach to runway 17L.  At 18:00, the approach controller asked flight 191 to reduce its airspeed to 170 knots, and to turn left to 270 degrees; flight 191 then acknowledged receipt of the clearance. Flight 191 had been sequenced behind a Learjet 25 for landing on runway 17L. At 18:02, the approach controller told flight 191 that it was 6 miles from the outer marker, requested that it turn to 180 degrees to join the localizer at or above 2,300 feet, and stated, ""Cleared for ILS one seven left approach."" The flight acknowledged receipt of the transmission.  At 18:03:03, the approach controller requested flight 191 ""to reduce your speed to one six zero please,"" and the captain replied, ""Be glad to."" Thereafter, at 18:03:30, he broadcast, ""And we're getting some variable winds out there due to a shower... out there north end of DFW."" This transmission was received by flight 191. At 18:03:46, the approach controller requested flight 191 to slow to 150 KIAS, and to contact the DFW Airport tower. At 18:03:58, the captain, after switching to the tower's radio frequency, stated, ""Tower, Delta one ninety one heavy, out here in the rain, feels good."" The tower cleared the flight to land and informed it, ""wind zero nine zero at five, gusts to one five."" At 18:04:07, the first officer called for the before-landing check. The flightcrew confirmed that the landing gear was down and that the flaps were extended to 33 degrees, the landing flap setting. At 18:04:18, the first officer said, ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, ""What?"" and the first officer repeated ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, and at 18:04:23, the first officer replied, ""Right ahead of us."" Flight 191 continued descending along the final approach course. At 18:05:05 the captain called out ""1,000 feet."" At 18:05:19, the captain cautioned the first officer to watch his indicated airspeed and a sound identified as rain began. The captain then warned the first officer, ""You're gonna lose it all of a sudden, there it is."" The captain stated, ""Push it up, push it way up."" At 18:05:29, the sound of engines at high rpm was heard on the CVR, and the captain said ""That's it."" At 18:05:44, the Ground Proximity Warning System's (GPWS) ""Whoop whoop pull up"" alert sounded and the captain commanded ""TOGA"". The CVR recording ended at 18:05:58. Witnesses on or near State Highway 114 north of the airport saw flight 191 emerge from the rain about 1.25 miles from the end of runway 17L and then strike an automobile in the westbound lane of State Highway 114. Subsequent investigation showed that the airplane had touched down earlier and became airborne again before striking the automobile. After the plane struck the car and a light pole on the highway, other witnesses saw fire on the left side of the airplane in the vicinity of the wing root. The witnesses generally agreed that the airplane struck the ground in a left-wing-low attitude, and that the fuselage rotated counterclockwise after the left wing and cockpit area struck a water tank on the airport. A large explosion obscured the witnesses' view momentarily, and then the tail section emerged from the fireball, skidding backwards. The tail section finally came to rest on its left side with the empennage pointing south and was subsequently blown to an upright position by wind gusts. One hundred and thirtyfour persons on board the airplane and the driver of the automobile which was struck by the airplane were killed in the accident; 27 persons on board the airplane and 1 rescue worker at the accident site were injured, 2 passengers on the airplane were uninjured.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's decision to initiate and continue the approach into a cumulonimbus cloud which they observed to contain visible lightning; the lack of specific guidelines, procedures and training for avoiding and escaping from low-level windshear; and the lack of definitive, real-time windshear hazard information. This resulted in the aircraft's encounter at low altitude with a microburst-induced, severe windshear from a rapidly developing thunderstorm located on the final approach course."""

The aircrtaft was destroyed and all 271 occupants were killed. Additionally, two persons on the ground sustained fatal injuries. At 14:59 hours local time Flight 191 taxied from the gate at O'Hare Airport. The flight was bound for Los Angeles, California, with 258 passengers and 13 crewmembers on board. Maintenance personnel who monitored the flight's engine start, push-back, and start of taxi did not observe anything out of the ordinary. The weather at the time of departure was clear, and the reported surface wind was 020° at 22 kts. Flight 191 was cleared to taxi to runway 32R for takeoff. The company's Takeoff Data Card showed that the stabilizer trim setting was 5° aircraft noseup, the takeoff flap setting was 10°, and the takeoff gross weight was 379,000 lbs. The target lowpressure compressor (N1) rpm setting was 99.4 percent, critical engine failure speed (V1) was 139 kts indicated airspeed (KIAS), rotation speed (VR) was 145 KIAS, and takeoff safety speed (V2) was 153 KIAS. Flight 191 was cleared to taxi into position on runway 32R and hold. At 15:02:38, the flight was cleared for takeoff, and at 15:02:46 the captain acknowledged, ""American one ninety-one under way."" The takeoff roll was normal until just before rotation at which time sections of the No.1 (left) engine pylon structure came off the aircraft. Witnesses saw white smoke or vapor coming from the vicinity of the No. 1 engine pylon. During rotation the entire No. 1 engine and pylon separated from the aircraft, went over the top of the wing, and fell to the runway. Flight 191 lifted off about 6,000 ft down runway 32R, climbed out in a wings-level attitude. About nine seconds after liftoff, the airplane had accelerated to 172 knots and reached 140 feet of altitude. As the climb continued, the airplane began to decelerate at a rate of about one knot per second, and at 20 seconds after liftoff, and an altitude of 325 feet, airspeed had been reduced to 159 knots. At this point, the airplane began to roll to the left, countered by rudder and aileron inputs. The airplane continued to roll until impact, 31 seconds after liftoff, and in a 112-degree left roll, and 21-degree nose down pitch attitude. At 15:04 Flight 191 crashed in an open field and trailer park about 4,600 ft northwest of the departure end of runway 32R. The aircraft was demolished during the impact, explosion, and ground fire.   The No.1 engine pylon failure during takeoff was determined to have been caused by unintended structural damage which occurred during engine/pylon reinstallation using a forklift. The engine/pylon removal and reinstallation were being conducted to implement two DC-10 Service Bulletins. Both required that the pylons be removed, and recommended that this be accomplished with the engines removed. The Service Bulletin instructions assumed that engines and pylons would be removed separately, and did not provide instructions to remove the engine and pylon as a unit. Additionally, removal of the engines and pylons as a unit was not an approved Maintenance Manual procedure. The lack of precision associated with the use of the forklift, essentially an inability to perform the fine manipulations necessary to accomplish reinstallation of the engine/strut assembly, in combination with the tight clearances between the pylon flange and the wing clevis resulted in damage to the same part that had just been inspected. Inspections of other DC-10 pylon mounts following the accident resulted in nine additional cracked mounts being identified.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems resulting from maintenance-induced damage leading to the separation of the no.1 engine and pylon assembly procedures which led to failure of the pylon structure. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the vulnerability of the design of the pylon attach points to maintenance damage; the vulnerability of the design of the leading edge slat system to the damage which produced asymmetry; deficiencies in FAA surveillance and reporting systems which failed to detect and prevent the use of improper maintenance procedures; deficiencies in the practices and communications among the operators, the manufacturer, and the FAA which failed to determine and disseminate the particulars regarding previous maintenance damage incidents; and the intolerance of prescribed operational procedures to this unique emergency."""
Sunday 5 July 1970,08:09,McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63,Air Canada,453,109,"11 km N of Toronto International Airport, ON (YYZ) - 
	   Canada",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,"Montreal-Dorval International Airport, QC (YUL/CYUL)","Toronto International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Air Canada flight 621 was a routine early morning flight originating from Montreal-Dorval International Airport, QC (YUL), with destination Toronto International Airport, ON (YYZ). The DC-8-63 plane, a relatively new airplane which had been delivered just over two months ago, departed at 07:17 for a flight which was to take just over 50 minutes. The captain was pilot flying. The enroute and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. At a distance of 8 miles from Toronto Airport, about 08:02, the ""Before-Landing Check"" was made. This included the lowering of the undercarriage and according to Air Canada procedures should include arming the spoilers. This item however was intentionally omitted. On previous flights were the captain and first officer had flown together they had disagreed on when to arm the spoilers. Both men did not like to arm the spoilers at the beginning of the final approach, fearing that this increased the chance of inadvertent spoiler activation. The captain preferred to arm the spoilers on the flare, while the first officer preferred to arm and extend them on the ground. Although both procedures where contrary to company policy, it was agreed between them that when the captain was flying the aircraft, the first officer would cause the spoilers to be extended on the ground, and when the first officer was flying the captain would arm the spoilers on the flare. However on this particular occasion, the captain and first officer had a discussion about when the spoilers should be armed. The captain finally ordered: ""All right, give them to me on the flare"", which was contrary to their personal agreement on previous flights. Power was reduced then on the aircraft for the purpose of the flare and the captain gave the order to the first officer by saying ""O.K.""; and immediately thereafter the ground spoilers were deployed. The aircraft was about 60 feet above runway 32 at that time and began to sink rapidly. The captain immediately noticed what had happened, applied full throttle to all four engines and pulled back the control column. The nose came up as the aircraft continued to sink. Realizing what he had done, the first officer apologized to the captain. The plane than struck the runway heavily, causing the number 4 engine and pylon to separate from the wing. It fell on the runway along with a piece of the lower wing plating, allowing fuel to escape and subsequently ignite. The DC-8 rose back into the air, at which time the ground spoilers retracted, and climbed to an altitude of 3100 feet. During this climb, fire and smoke were seen trailing behind the aircraft intermittently. The crew wanted to circle for an emergency landing on runway 32. This was not possible because of debris on the runway, so the controller suggested a landing on runway 23. About two and a half minutes after the initial touchdown an explosion occurred in the right wing outboard of the number 4 engine location causing parts of the outer wing structure to fall free to the ground. Six seconds later, a second explosion occurred in the vicinity of number 3 engine and the engine with its pylon ripped free of the wing and fell to the ground in flames. Six and one half seconds later, a third explosion occurred which caused the loss of a large section of the right wing, including the wing tip. The airplane then went into a violent manoeuvre, lost height rapidly and at the same time more wing plating tore free following which the DC-8 struck the ground at a high velocity, about 220 knots in a left wing high and nose low attitude.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The Canadian investigation report did not conform to ICAO standards and did not contain a probable cause as such."

Most of the wreckage sank to a depth of some 3500 metres. The cause of the accident has never been officially established. In the years following the accident many theories were suggested. Some theories cantered around the fact that the DC-9 may have accidentally been shot down by NATO fighters. Either during an exercise involving Italian, U.S., and French jet fighters, or during a dog fight involving Libyan, U.S., French and Italian Air Force fighters in the area. It has also been suggested that explosive device detonated in the rear (starboard) toilet."

	   Canada",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)",Genève-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG),"At 20:18 Swissair flight SR 111, departed New York-JFK Airport on a flight to Geneva, Switzerland. Forty minutes later the copilot contacted Moncton ACC, reporting FL330. At 21:10 the pilots detected an unusual odour in the cockpit and began to investigate. They determined that some smoke was present in the cockpit, but not in the passenger cabin. They assessed that the odour and smoke were related to the air conditioning system. Four minutes later a Pan Pan radio call was made to Moncton ACC. The aircraft was about 66 nm southwest of Halifax. The pilots reported that there was smoke in the cockpit and requested an immediate return to a convenient place. The pilots named Boston, which was about 300 nm behind them. The Moncton ACC controller immediately cleared SR 111 to turn right toward Boston and to descend to FL310. Then the controller asked SR 111 whether they preferred to go to Halifax. The pilots expressed a preference for Halifax. They immediately received an ATS clearance to fly directly to Halifax. At this time, the pilots donned their oxygen masks. At 21:16, the controller cleared SR 111 to descend to 10000 feet. Two minutes later they were cleared down to 3000 feet. At 21:19, the controller instructed SR 111 to turn left to a heading of 030 for a landing on runway 06 at the Halifax, and advised that the aircraft was 30 nm from the runway threshold. The aircraft was descending through approximately FL210 and the pilots indicated that they needed more than 30 nm. The controller instructed SR 111 to turn to a heading of 360 to provide more track distance for the aircraft to lose altitude. The flight crew discussed internally the dumping of fuel based on the aircraft's gross weight, and on their perception of the cues regarding the aircraft condition, and agreed to dump fuel. The flight was vectored to the south to dump fuel. At 21:24, both pilots almost simultaneously declared an emergency. The co-pilot indicated to the controller that they were starting to dump fuel and that they had to land immediately. Last radio contact was one minute later when they again declared an emergency. By now the fire had propagated, causing severe disturbances of the electric system. In the last minutes of the flight, the electronic navigation equipment and communications radios stopped operating. The aircraft descended over the dark waters off the coast of Nova Scotia until it stuck the water in a 20 degrees nose down and 110 degrees right bank.  FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:    1. Aircraft certification standards for material flammability were inadequate in that they allowed the use of materials that could be ignited and sustain or propagate fire. Consequently, flammable material propagated a fire that started above the ceiling on the right side of the cockpit near the cockpit rear wall. The fire spread and intensified rapidly to the extent that it degraded aircraft systems and the cockpit environment, and ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft.     2. Metallized polyethylene terephthalate (MPET)-type cover material on the thermal acoustic insulation blankets used in the aircraft was flammable. The cover material was most likely the first material to ignite, and constituted the largest portion of the combustible materials that contributed to the propagation and intensity of the fire.     3. Once ignited, other types of thermal acoustic insulation cover materials exhibit flame propagation characteristics similar to MPET-covered insulation blankets and do not meet the proposed revised flammability test criteria. Metallized polyvinyl fluoridetype cover material was installed in HB-IWF and was involved in the in-flight fire.     4. Silicone elastomeric end caps, hook-and-loop fasteners, foams, adhesives, and thermal acoustic insulation splicing tapes contributed to the propagation and intensity of the fire.     5. The type of circuit breakers (CB) used in the aircraft were similar to those in general aircraft use, and were not capable of protecting against all types of wire arcing events. The fire most likely started from a wire arcing event.     6. A segment of in-flight entertainment network (IFEN) power supply unit cable (1-3791) exhibited a region of resolidified copper on one wire that was caused by an arcing event. This resolidified copper was determined to be located near manufacturing station 383, in the area where the fire most likely originated. This arc was likely associated with the fire initiation event; however, it could not be determined whether this arced wire was the lead event.     7. There were no built-in smoke and fire detection and suppression devices in the area where the fire started and propagated, nor were they required by regulation. The lack of such devices delayed the identification of the existence of the fire, and allowed the fire to propagate unchecked until it became uncontrollable.     8. There was a reliance on sight and smell to detect and differentiate between odour or smoke from different potential sources. This reliance resulted in the misidentification of the initial odour and smoke as originating from an air conditioning source.     9. There was no integrated in-flight firefighting plan in place for the accident aircraft, nor was such a plan required by regulation. Therefore, the aircraft crew did not have procedures or training directing them to aggressively attempt to locate and eliminate the source of the smoke, and to expedite their preparations for a possible emergency landing. In the absence of such a firefighting plan, they concentrated on preparing the aircraft for the diversion and landing.    10. There is no requirement that a fire-induced failure be considered when completing the system safety analysis required for certification. The fire-related failure of silicone elastomeric end caps installed on air conditioning ducts resulted in the addition of a continuous supply of conditioned air that contributed to the propagation and intensity of the fire.    11. The loss of primary flight displays and lack of outside visual references forced the pilots to be reliant on the standby instruments for at least some portion of the last minutes of the flight. In the deteriorating cockpit environment, the positioning and small size of these instruments would have made it difficult for the pilots to transition to their use, and to continue to maintain the proper spatial orientation of the aircraft."

Ordaz Airport (PVR/MMPR),"San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO/KSFO)","Alaska Airlines Flight 261 departed Puerto Vallarta at about 14:30 PST for a flight to San Francisco and Seattle. En route to San Francisco a FL310 a problem arose with the stabilizer trim. At 16:10 the crew radioed Los Angeles ARTCC that they were having control problems and that they were descending through FL260. At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16. The crew then requested permission to descend to FL100 over water to change their aircraft configuration . Los Angeles cleared them to FL170. Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems. As the crew attempted to diagnose or correct the problem the out-of-trim condition became worse, causing a tendency for the plane to pitch nose-down. When preparing the plane for landing control was lost and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'. The aircraft crashed off Point Mugu in 650 feet deep water.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblys acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads, and Alaska Airlines extended end play check interval and the FAAs approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss."""

Of the 78 persons on board, 41 did not survive. The aircraft took off from Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 24C at 18:03 hours local time on a scheduled service to Murmansk, Russia. Visibility was fine but there were some Cumulonimbus clouds near the airfield at 6000 feet. The flight crew engaged the autopilot as the aircraft climbed through a height of 700 ft (215 m). At 18:08, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of about 8900 ft (2700 m), a failure occurred in the electrical system. At this point, the aircraft was 30 km west-northwest of the airport in an area of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft and the crew managed to establish radio contact using UHF. The flight was not able to contact the approach controller and subsequently selected the emergency transponder code 7600 (loss of radio communication). About 18:17 the aircraft overshot the runway centreline after turning to runway heading. Altitude at that time was about 2400 feet. The aircraft continued the right-hand turn, completed a circle and proceeded on the final approach for runway 24L. Flaps were selected at 25°, which was the recommended setting for landing above maximum landing weight. At 18:26 the flight crew selected the emergency transponder code 7700 (emergency). When descending from 335 to 275 m (1100-900 ft) the windshear warning system sounded five times: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". From a height of 80 m (260 ft) above ground level, the aircraft descended below the glide path and at a height of 55 m (180 ft) the TAWS warning sounded: ""Glide Slope."" From that moment on the airspeed increased to 170 knots. At 18:30 the aircraft overflew the runway threshold and touched down at a distance of 900 m past the threshold at a speed of 158 knots. Touchdown occurred at a g-force of at least 2.55g with a subsequent bounce to a height of about 2 m. After two seconds the aircraft landed again on the nose landing gear with a vertical load 5.85g, and bounced to a height of 6 m. The third landing of the aircraft occurred at a speed of 140 knots with a vertical overload of at least 5g. This caused a rupture of the wing structure and fuel lines. Flames erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The aircraft slid to a stop on the grass between runway 24L and two taxiways. An emergency evacuation was then carried out while flames quickly engulfed the rear fuselage."

The flight to Addis Ababa was uneventful and the VC10 landed there at 08:23. During the transit stop at Addis Ababa, some freight was off-loaded together with 40 passengers. Fifteen passengers joined the flight and the airplane was refuelled. Start up clearance was given at 09:21 hours and the aircraft taxied out six minutes later via the eastern taxiway for takeoff on runway 07. The tower advised the aircraft that the wind was 5 knots and variable in direction. At 09:32 hours, as the aircraft was backtracking to the takeoff point, the pilot reported a number of dead birds on the runway. He requested that these birds be removed before the aircraft took off. A fire truck was dispatched to take care of this. The aircraft continued to backtrack down the runway and turned in the pad at the end. It then lined up on the runway and stopped a short distance from the threshold.  At 09:38:40 hours, the tower cleared the aircraft for takeoff. Shortly after the aircraft had passed the mid-point of the runway, at or just below the V1 speed, the nose wheel ran over a steel jacking pad. This jacking pad belonged to a Cessna 185 that had departed 4:40 hrs earlier. The pad punctured the right hand nose wheel tire. A loud bang was heard and severe vibration was felt on the flight deck. Almost immediately after the nose wheel tire had burst, the nose of the aircraft rose momentarily and then come down. The flight crew decided to abort the takeoff. The engines were throttled back and reverse thrust was selected. The aircraft continued down the runway, veering slightly to the right.  Then the no.1 rear main tire burst. Just before the aircraft reached the end of the runway, it veered slightly to the left and ran approximately parallel to the centre line. After crossing a storm drain located at the end of the runway at right angles to the centre line, the aircraft became momentarily airborne as it left the lip of the embankment on which the 60 m stopway was laid. As it did so, the left outer wing of the aircraft struck a steel lattice tower forming part of the approach lighting system to runway 25. This ruptured the no. 1A fuel tank and the released fuel promptly ignited. Sixty metres beyond the end of the runway the aircraft fell heavily on to the lower ground 10.6 m below the runway level. It broke up immediately on impact and after sliding a short distance, came to rest and caught fire.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was due to a partial loss of braking effort arising from incorrect re-assembly of part of the braking system, as a result of which the aircraft could not be stopped within the emergency distance remaining following a properly executed abandoned take-off procedure."""

Destination of the flight was Kiev-Borispol Airport. Cruising altitude was 9000 m. The aircraft lost control and crashed from an altitude of FL300 following the failure of the horizontal stabilizer jackscrew due to fatigue. The crew completed pre-landing briefing and checks at 10:48. The flight was then cleared to descend to 7800 m. The crew confirmed this clearance. The descent was initiated and the horizontal stabilizer was trimmed nose down. It moved to +0.3° until it suddenly instantaneously moved beyond the mechanical stop (+2°). The aircraft pitched nose down and the flight crew were not able to regain control. An overload on the aircraft structure caused it to break up at an altitude of 5700 m.  Conclusion: the cause of the disaster is a sharp spontaneous transfer of the stabilizer to a dive due to the disconnection of the screw pair of the stabilizer shift mechanism due to the almost complete wear of the nut thread. This led to acceleration and subsequent destruction of the aircraft in the air from the action of off-design aerodynamic loads.

	   United States of America",Standing,Passenger - Scheduled,"Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA)","Port Au Prince,  (MTPP)","After takeoff from Miami, the flight experienced a pressurization system malfunction, which the captain identified as the airplane depressurizing.  The flight attendants and passengers complained of pain in their ears at that time. The flight crew placed the pressurization system into manual control, turned off the autopilot and autothrottle systems, and began a descent to return to Miami. During the return to Miami, several lavatory smoke alarms activated and the captain call light illuminated in the cabin; however, no evidence of fire or smoke was found.  The flight crew did not complete the checklists for manual pressurization control and emergency landing during the return to Miami, both of which called for the airplane to be depressurized prior to landing.   After landing and stopping on a taxiway, the captain also noticed an aft baggage compartment fire loop light illuminated, prompting him to evacuate the airplane.  After the captain ordered the evacuation, the flight attendants attempted to open the doors.  The doors would not open.  The flight attendant/purser at the L1 (front left passenger) door continued to attempt to open the door, and the door explosively opened, ejecting the flight attendant/purser from the airplane to the ground, causing fatal injuries. The remainder of the doors opened and the airplane was evacuated. The emergency evacuation checklist did not call for the flight crew to check for depressurization of the airplane prior to commanding an evacuation.   Post-accident examination of the airplane revealed that insulation blankets, which had been manufactured and replaced by the airplane operator's maintenance personnel, had not been properly secured per the airplane manufacturer's data.  The blanket had migrated over to, and partially blocked, the forward and aft pressurization outflow valves, leading to the pressurization system malfunction. The forward outflow valve was found 3/8-open and the aft outflow valve was found fully closed.   The lavatory smoke alarms were found to activate when subjected to abnormal pressure. There were no FAA technical standards for the lavatory smoke detectors. A sensor in the aft cargo compartment was found out of tolerance and also activated when subjected to abnormal pressure.   The cabin doors were found to have no means for relieving pressure prior to opening the doors.   The cabin altimeter in the cockpit did not have a mechanical stop in the negative direction, and under excessive pressure conditions, allowed the needle to move past the negative range into the high positive range.   The aircraft manufacturer stated that when the pressurization system is in the manual mode, the outflow valves do not automatically open during landing and that a person cannot open a door if the airplane is pressurized above approximately 1.5 psi differential.    As result of this investigation, the Safety Board previously issued 18 safety recommendations to the FAA.   Probable Cause: The failure of the flight crew to perform the cabin pressurization manual control abnormal checklist after experiencing a pressurization system malfunction and switching to manual pressurization control, and the failure of the flight crew to perform the emergency landing checklist prior to landing, resulting in the airplane having an excessive cabin pressure level after landing which led to a rapid decompression of the airplane when a flight attendant opened door and was ejected out of the airplane during emergency evacuation that was initiated by the captain.   Contributing to the accident was the failure of operator maintenance personnel to ensure that insulation blankets around the forward and aft outflow valves were properly secured in accordance with airplane manufacturer's data, resulting in a malfunction of the pressurization system.   Other contributing factors include the absence of FAA requirements that each emergency exit door has a system to relieve pressure or contain specific warnings (such as lights, placards, or other indications that clearly identify the danger of opening the emergency exit doors when the airplane is over pressurized); the absence of FAA technical specifications for lavatory ionization smoke detectors; the absence of a requirement in the airplane's ground/emergency evacuation checklist for the flight crew to ensure that the cabin differential pressure is zero pounds per square inch before signaling flight attendants to begin an emergency evacuation; and the absence of a mechanical stop in the negative direction on the cabin altimeter gauge."

All 234 occupants suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft, an Airbus A300B4-220, was cleared for an ILS approach to Medan's runway 05 and was flying on a 316 degree heading on Airway 585/W12. Having descended to 3000 feet the crew were instructed to turn left, heading 240 degrees for vectoring to intercept the runway 05 ILS. The flight crew did not respond to this instruction, as the controller addressed the call to 'Merpati 152'. The instructions were repeated, this time using the correct call sign. The flight crew replied: ""GIA 152 heading 235. Confirm we cleared from a (pause) mountainous area?"" At 13:28 the controller confirmed they were turning towards a mountainous area and the flight was instructed to continue on a 215 degree heading. At 13:30 ATC directed the flight to turn right heading 046 and report when established on the localizer. Although the clearance for a right hand turn had been read back correctly, confusion on the part of the air traffic controller followed over whether GA152 was turning left or right: ""152, confirm you're making turning left now?"" Garuda 152 responded, as cleared, that they were turning right. The controller subsequently added to the confusion by stating: ""152 OK, you continue turning left now.""  This was contrary to the crew's expectations, so they enquired: ""A (pause) confirm turning left? We are starting turning right now."" The controller, possibly realising his error, replied: ""OK (pause). OK..... GIA 152 continue turn right heading 015."" Ten seconds later, the Airbus impacted a wooded area, broke up and burst into flames. The wreckage covered a 150x75 m area near the village of Pancur Batu, which is located at 900-1000 meters amsl.  The region was affected by smog from forest fires; visibility was reported to be 600-800 meters.  Probable Cause: ""There was confusion regarding turning direction of left turn instead of right turn at critical position during radar vectoring that reduced the flight crews vertical awareness while they were concentrating on the aircrafts lateral changes. These caused the aircraft to continue descending below the assigned altitude of 2000 ft and hit treetops at 1550 ft above mean sea level."""

At 18:26 hours, the co-pilot first established contact with the Surat Thani approach controller while the aircraft was 70 nautical miles away from Surat Thani Airport. The controller radioed that the crew could expect a VOR/DME instrument approach to runway 22. At that time surface wind was calm with a visibility of 1500 meters, light rain and a cloud base of 1800 feet. At 18:39 hours the co-pilot contacted Surat Thani aerodrome controller and reported over the Intermediate Fix (IF). The controller informed him that the precision approach path indicators (PAPI) on the right side of runway 22 were unserviceable while the left lights were in use. At 18:41 hours, the co-pilot reported passing final approach fix (FAF). The controller informed the pilot that the aircraft was not in sight but it was cleared to land on runway 22. The surface wind was blowing from 310 degrees at a velocity of 5 knots so the pilots should be careful or the slippery runway. At 18:42 hours, the co-pilot reported that the runway was in sight and later on the controller also had the aircraft in sight. The pilot decided to go-around. The controller asked the pilot about the distance where the runway could be seen. The co-pilot reported that it could be seen at 3 nautical miles and requested for the second approach. The controller requested to report over FAF . When the co-pilot reported that the flight was over the FAF again, the controller cleared the flight to land although he again could not see the runway. When the flight crew failed to observe the runway lights, the captain decided to go around again.  Again the controller instructed the flight to report over the FAF and reported that visibility had decreased to 1000 meters in light rain. At 19:05, after reporting over the FAF, the flight was cleared to land on runway 22. The flight maintained the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) but the crew were unable to see the runway. The autopilot was disconnected and a little later the captain decided to go around. The pitch attitude increased continuously. The pitch attitude reached approximately 40 degrees, when the pilot applied the elevator decreasing the pitch attitude to 32-33 degrees. When he discontinued applying elevator the pitch increased to 47-48 degrees. Consequently the speed decreased to 100 knots. The captain was not aware of the attitude due to stress and the expectation that the go around was flown exactly like the first two go-arounds. The airplane lost altitude until it impacted terrain to the left of the runway.  Probable Causes: After careful consideration. the Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee of the Kingdom of Thailand ultimately came to the conclusion that the accident occurred because the aircraft entered into stall condition which might be caused by the followings: 1. The pilot attempted to approach the airport in lower than minimum visibility with rain. 2. The pilot could not maintain the VOR course as set forth in the approach chart. The aircraft flew left of VOR course on every approach. 3. The pilots suffered from the accumulation of stress and were not aware of the situation until the aircraft emerged into the upset condition. 4. The pilots had not been informed of the document concerning the wide-body airplane upset recovery provided by Airbus Industrie for using in pilot training. 5. The lighting system and approach chart did not facilitate the low visibility approach. 6. Stall warning and pitch trim systems might not fully function as described in the FCOM and AMM."

At about 10:25 local time an An-124, property of Aeroflot and operated by Ajax was flying empty from Russia to Turin, Italy, to collect Ferrari cars to be delivered in Brunei. After having failed to land on runway 36 at Caselle Airport, while trying to go-around from an altitude of about 15 meters (50 ft) above the runway, the aircraft struck trees and houses in the small town of San Francesco al Campo, north of the runway end. At that runway 36 time was undergoing resurfacing works near the threshold. The cat.III ILS was operating as Localizer only, because the glide slope was turned off during the works. The usable length of the runway was reduced to 2350 meters from 3300, due to work in progress. All these informations were included in a regular NOTAM and the crew was advised accordingly at first contact from the Turin Radar controller. Reported weather at time of crash (10:20 local) was: wind variable, 3 knots, visibility 2000 m, RVR runway 36 more than 1500 meters, no change, light rain, scattered at 1500 feet, scattered at 3500 feet, broken at 7000 feet, temperature and dew point 13°C, QNH 1012 hPa. After descending through the clouds, the airplane passed the threshold of runway 36 at an altitude higher than planned. Believing that the remaining runway length would not be long enough for a safe landing, the co-pilot suggested on going around, while the captain made the decision to land. When the wheels were 1 meter above the runway, the remaining runway length was 1350 meters.  The captain now decided to go around and selected takeoff power. However, due to design flaws in the engine control system, as well as abrupt shifting of the engine throttle to take-off mode, only one engine entered take-off mode. The airplane was unable to gain altitude, losing speed and increasing the angle of attack. At 10:50, about 1 km north of the end of runway 36, it hit trees and touched the roof of a two-story house in the town of San Francesco al Campo. The aircraft hit the ground, collided with a building and caught fire.   It seems that poor crew coordination and training (the captain had just 431 hours on the civil type), poor approach planning (no planning was made for a possible missed approach, despite the crew having been informed by the Tower eleven minutes before the crash that the preceding aircraft had got the runway in sight at just 200 feet), late decision to start the missed approach have all contributed to the crash."

Nineteen minutes into the flight there was a momentary failure of these altimeters as well, with the altitude dropping from 696 to -1375 metres. Three minutes later the altimeter again suffered a momentary spike, this time from 749 m to 2672 m. En route and during the descent towards Shymkent the flight encountered poor weather with heavy snowfall and limited visibility. During the approach to Shymkent, the captain failed to set the correct pressure for the barometric altimeters. The altitude indicated was therefore off by about 385 metres.

Five of the 113 occupants survived the crash. Flight LN114 was a scheduled service from Tripoli, Libya to Benghazi, Libya and Cairo, Egypt. The aircraft departed Benghazi at 10:40 hours UTC. Weather conditions on the route to Cairo included a low stratocumulus and 6/8 to 8/8 altocumulus up to about FL180.  The flight reported to Benghazi Approach over Labraq NDB at 10:54 hours at FL200. From there the aircraft began to drift north of the required track as it climbed to the cruising altitude of FL290. After passing the Sidi Barrani NDB it drifted to the east (left) of the required track the angle of divergence being some 9°. At 11:44 the copilot radioed Cairo ACC and reported a planned passage of the Qarun VOR at 11:52 hours. At 11:46 hours the pilot-in-commend observed that the Qarun VOR was behind the aircraft and that he had a bearing from Cairo different to that anticipated. While the copilot was flying the aircraft, the captain and flight engineer began discussing the navigational problems in French, a language the copilot barely understood. The co-pilot reported as being over Qarun VOR at 11:52 hours and requested a clearance to descend. The aircraft's actual position was some 94 miles east-south-east of Qarun approaching the Gulf of Suez. The flight was cleared to descend to FL140. At about 11:57 hours the aircraft crossed the northern coast of the Gulf of Suez and entered the Sinai, maintaining FL140. Since the flight was off course, the flight crew failed to capture the necessary navigational beacons for the approach to Cairo. Meanwhile, at 11:54 hours the Israeli Defense Forces became apprehensive when they detected an unidentified aircraft (5A-DAH) approaching the Gulf of Suez on a track leading towards the Bir Gafgafa Air Base, which was operated by Israel at the time. Ground and air defense forces were alerted and two McDonnell F-4E Phantom II fighters commenced an interception in order to identify the aircraft. The co-pilot of reported to Cairo Approach that the aircraft was 10 miles from Cairo while the actual position of 5A-DAH was approximately 15 miles southwest of Bir Gafgafa with 5A-DAH tracking in a northeasterly direction. The Boeing 727 was cleared down to 4000 feet and cleared to the LU locator which the pilot had reported approaching. Cairo was in fact some 105 miles distant and the LU locator was designed for an effective range of 20 miles. At 12:01 hours the aircraft commenced descent at 3000 fpm and the heading which had wandered over the past 3 minutes to 010 was returned to 050 which placed the aircraft direct on track for Bir Gafgafa. At this time the two Phantom aircraft were less than 2 miles behind 5A-DAH.  Then the captain commented to the co-pilot that they were ""far away"" and again talked to the flight engineer to tune the radio navigation equipment. While descending through 6000 feet the copilot noticed the fighter aircraft. The aircraft was then turned from a heading of 050° to approximately 260°, the general direction of Cairo, and levelled off at about 6000 feet. At 12:04 the Section Leader of the Phantom aircraft placed his aircraft on the starboard side of 5A-DAH so that he personally was about 12 metres from the co-pilot and by hand-signals pointed down towards Bir Gafgafa a number of times. The co-pilot advised the captain that the Phantom pilot was trying to indicate something. The Phantom pilot then rocked his wings, indicating to follow him. The copilot commented to the captain that he did not understand this. When the Section Leader again signaled by hand to fly down to Bir Gafgafa, the copilot either waved or indicated straight-ahead; the captain and flight engineer continued operating the radio navigation equipment. Cairo Approach Control then cleared to flight to climb to FL100. As the aircraft began to increase the rate of climb, the Phantom Section Leader fired a burst of gun-fire with tracers in front of 5A-DAH and across the flight path.  Engine power was reduced and the aircraft descended at 1000 ft/min whilst all three crew members attempted to tune in the Cairo ILS. At about 12:08 hours the captain observed one of the Phantom aircraft returning and three short bursts of gunfire (20 mm) were directed towards the starboard wing root area. 5A-DAH was at 5000 feet at the time. The captain immediately advised Cairo Approach Control that he had ""serious troubles"" and that 5A-DAH had been ""shot by a fighter"". A few seconds later the co-pilot identified to the captain that it was an Israeli fighter.  Over the next minute the aircraft descended at 1500-2000 feet per minute while maintaining heading. At 12:09 two engines failed or were shut down at about 3000 ft altitude. The aircraft continued its descent apparently under control with a fire burning in the starboard wing root area and which entered the passenger cabin.  The starboard wing struck the lip of a sand ridge very heavily followed by heavy impact on the rear underside of the fuselage. The aircraft rolled inverted and skidded to a halt at 12:11 UTC (14:11 local time)."

The descent towards Guilin was carried out with autothrottle engaged. During the visual approach to runway 36, at an altitude of about 7000 feet, the captain attempted to level off the plane by raising the nose of the airplane. The autothrottle responded by advancing the throttles. The no. 2 power lever however remained at idle. The crew apparently did not notice this. With the no. 2 engine at idle, the autothrottle further advanced the no. 1 power lever in order to obtain the correct airspeed. The asymmetrical power condition was not corrected and the airplane rolled to the right. Control was lost and the airplane impacted terrain near Liutang."

	   Tunisia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Cairo International Airport (CAI/HECA),Tunis-Carthage Airport (TUN/DTTA),"EgyptAir Flight 843, a Boeing 737-500, departed Cairo at 13:40 for a flight to Tunis. At 15:00 hours local time the aircraft was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 11 at Tunis-Carthage Airport. The flight crew did not conduct a verbal approach briefing prior to or during the descent.  The approach procedure stipulates that the aircraft must cross the Initial Approach Fix (IF), located at 11 DME, at 2100 feet. This altitude has to be maintained to the Final Approach Fix (FAF) at 6 DME. However, flight 843 began the descent prematurely while still at 6.8 DME.  During the final approach there was no verbal mention of the 1000 ft passage. Descent was continued through clouds until the aircraft impacted the side of a hill at 750 feet, 6,6 km short of the runway. The aircraft was not equipped with an EGPWS. The investigation determined that an EGPWS would have give a ""Caution Terrain"" warning 32 seconds before the impact, followed by ""Terrain, terrain. Pull up, pull up"" three seconds later.  Cause of the accident: The accident resulted from the crew's failure to execute and control the final approach. This was evidenced by the failure to respect the approach fix associated with the decision to begin the final approach prematurely. Contributing to the accident were the following factors: - The adverse weather conditions at the time of the accident, including reduced visibility; - The shortcomings noted in the training of both pilots, particularly those relating to conventional VOR/DME approaches; - The relative weakness of the flight experience of the two crew members on the aircraft type being operated."
Saturday 22 May 2010,06:05,Boeing 737-8HG (WL),Air India Express,7199,158,"Mangalore-Bajpe Airport (IXE) - 
	   India",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB),Mangalore-Bajpe Airport (IXE/VOML),"Air India Express flight IX-811/812 is a daily round trip between Mangalore and Dubai. The outbound flight IX-811 was uneventful and landed at Dubai at 23:44 hours Local Time. The airplane was serviced and refuelled. The same flight crew operated the return leg, flight IX-812.  The airplane taxied out for departure at 01:06 LT (02:36 IST). The takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. There was no conversation between the two pilots for about 1 hour and 40 minutes because the captain was asleep. The First Officer was making all the radio calls. The aircraft reported position at IGAMA at 05:33 hours IST and the First Officer was told to expect an ILS DME Arc approach to Mangalore. At about 130 miles from Mangalore, the First Officer requested descent clearance. This was, however, denied by the ATC Controller, who was using standard procedural control, to ensure safe separation with other air traffic. At 05:46 IST, the flight reported its position when it was at 80 DME as instructed by Mangalore Area Control. The aircraft was cleared to 7000 ft and commenced descent at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47 IST. The visibility reported was 6 km. Mangalore airport has a table top runway. As the AIP India states ""Aerodrome located on hilltop. Valleys 200ft to 250ft immediately beyond paved surface of Runway."" Owing to the surrounding terrain, Air India Express had made a special qualification requirement that only the PIC shall carry out the take off and landing. The captain on the accident flight had made a total of 16 landings in the past at this airport and the First Officer had operated as a Co-pilot on 66 flights at this airport. While the aircraft had commenced descent, there was no recorded conversation regarding the mandatory preparation for descent and landing briefing as stipulated in the SOP. After the aircraft was at about 50 miles and descending out of FL295, the conversation between the two pilots indicated that an incomplete approach briefing had been carried out. At about 25 nm from DME and descending through FL184, the Mangalore Area Controller cleared the aircraft to continue descent to 2900 ft. At this stage, the First Officer requested, if they could proceed directly to Radial 338 and join the 10 DME Arc. Throughout the descent profile and DME Arc Approach for ILS 24, the aircraft was much higher than normally expected altitudes. The aircraft was handed over by the Mangalore Area Controller to ATC Tower at 05:52 IST. The Tower controller, thereafter, asked the aircraft to report having established on 10 DME Arc for ILS Runway 24. Considering that this flight was operating in WOCL (Window Of Circadian Low), by this time the First Officer had also shown signs of tiredness. This was indicated by the sounds of yawning heard on the CVR. On having reported 10 DME Arc, the ATC Tower had asked aircraft to report when established on ILS. It appears that the captain had realised that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal and had selected Landing Gear 'DOWN' at an altitude of approximately 8,500 ft with speed brakes still deployed in Flight Detent position, so as to increase the rate of descent. As indicated by the DFDR, the aircraft continued to be high and did not follow the standard procedure of intercepting the ILS Glide Path at the correct intercept altitude. This incorrect procedure led to the aircraft being at almost twice the altitude as compared to a Standard ILS Approach. During approach, the CVR indicated that the captain had selected Flaps 40 degrees and completed the Landing Check List. At 06:03 hours IST at about 2.5 DME, the Radio Altimeter had alerted an altitude of 2500 ft. This was immediately followed by the First Officer saying ""It is too high"" and ""Runway straight down"". In reply, the captain had exclaimed ""Oh my god"". At this moment, the captain had disconnected the Auto Pilot and simultaneously increased the rate of descent considerably to establish on the desired approach path. At this stage, the First Officer had queried ""Go around?"" To this query from the First Officer, the captain had called out ""Wrong loc .. ... localiser .. ... glide path"".  The First Officer had given a second call to the captain for ""Go around"" followed by ""Unstabilised"". However, the First Officer did not appear to take any action, to initiate a Go Around. Having acquired the runway visually and to execute a landing, it appears that the captain had increased the rate of descent to almost 4000 ft per minute. Due to this, there were numerous warnings from EGPWS for 'SINK RATE' and 'PULL UP'. On their own, the pilots did not report having established on ILS Approach. Instead, the ATC Tower had queried the same. To this call, the captain had forcefully prompted the First Officer to give a call of ""Affirmative"". The Tower controller gave landing clearance thereafter and also indicated ""Winds calm"". The aircraft was high on approach and touched down on the runway, much farther than normal. The aircraft had crossed the threshold at about 200 ft altitude with indicated speed in excess of 160 kt, as compared to 50 ft with target speed of 144 kt for the landing weight. Despite the EGPWS warnings and calls from the First Officer to go around, the captain had persisted with the approach in unstabilised conditions. Short of touchdown, there was yet another (Third) call from the First Officer, ""Go around captain...We don't have runway left"". However, the captain had continued with the landing and the final touchdown was about 5200 ft from the threshold of runway 24, leaving approximately 2800 ft of remaining paved surface. The captain had selected Thrust Reversers soon after touchdown. Within 6 seconds of applying brakes, the captain had initiated a 'Go Around', in contravention of Boeing SOP. The aircraft overshot the runway including the strip of 60 metres. After overshooting the runway and strip, the aircraft continued into the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of 90 metres. Soon after which the right wing impacted the localiser antenna structure located further at 85 metres from the end of RESA. Thereafter, the aircraft hit the boundary fence and fell into a gorge.  CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: Direct Causes: The Court of Inquiry determines that the cause of this accident was Captain's failure to discontinue the 'unstabilised approach' and his persistence in continuing with the landing, despite three calls from the First Officer to 'go around' and a number of warnings from EGPWS. Contributing Factors to the Accident: 1. In spite of availability of adequate rest period prior to the flight, the Captain was in prolonged sleep during flight, which could have led to sleep inertia. As a resu lt of relatively short period of time between his awakening and the approach, it possibly led to impaired judgment. This aspect might have got accentuated while flying in the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL). 2. In the absence of Mangalore Area Control Radar (MSSR), due to unserviceability, the aircraft was given descent at a shorter distance on DME as compared to the normal. However, the flight crew did not plan the descent profile properly, resulting in remaining high on approach. 3. Probably in view of ambiguity in various instructions empowering the 'copilot' to initiate a 'go around ', the First Officer gave repeated calls to this effect, but did not take over the controls to actually discontinue the ill-fated approach."

During the stopover at Karachi, as passengers boarded the aircraft for the flight, a van that had been modified to look like an airport security vehicle, drove through a security checkpoint up to one of the boarding stairways of the aircraft. Four hijackers stormed up the stairways into the plane, fired shots from an automatic weapon and seized control of the aircraft. Flight attendants were able to alert the cockpit crew using intercom, allowing the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer to escape through a hatch in the cockpit. During the following 16 hours, Zayd Hassan Safarini, the Jordanian leader of the hijackers, demanded the return of the flight crew to fly the aircraft to Larnaca, Cyprus, where he wanted to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners being detained in Cyprus. During negotiations between Safarini and Pakistani authorities, Safarini threatened to kill all passengers. Four hours into the hijacking, one of the passengers was shot and pushed out the door onto the tarmac below. As nightfall arrived, the hijackers herded the passengers and crew members into the center section of the aircraft. The four hijackers opened fire on the passengers and crew, and threw grenades among them, killing almost 20. Most of the survivors escaped through two doors of the plane which were opened when the firing began. Pakistani special forces commando's then stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers."
Saturday 28 November 1987,04:07,Boeing 747-244B,South African Airways - SAA,26743,159,"250 km NE off Mauritius - 
	   Indian Ocean",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Chiang Kai Shek International Airport (TPE/RCTP),Mauritius-Plaisance International Airport (MRU/FIMP),"On November 27th 1987 flight SA295 was scheduled to depart from Taipei's Chiang Kai Shek Airport at 13:00 UTC for Mauritius' Plaisance Airport and Johannesburg, South Africa on a scheduled international air transport service. Due to adverse weather and the late arrival of a connecting flight the departure time was delayed and the airplane took off at 14:23 UTC with 149000 kg of fuel, 43225 kg of baggage and cargo, 140 passengers and a crew comprising 5 flight crew members and 14 cabin crew members. The calculated flight time was 10 hours 14 minutes.  The take-off was normal. At 14:56 UTC the crew communicated with Hong Kong Radar and thereafter routine position reports were given to the flight information centres (FICs) at Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Colombo, Cocos Islands and Mauritius. At 15:55 a routine report was made to the Operator's base at Johannesburg. The information given was that the airplane had taken off from Taipei at 14:23, was flying at FL310 and that the arrival time at Mauritius was estimated as 00:35 UTC.  At about 22:30 the pilot called Mauritius FIC, using HF radio, and advised that the aircraft had been at position 070° East at 22:29 at FL350 and that the time at position 065° East was estimated as 23:12. At 23:13 the position report of 065° East at FL350 was given to Mauritius FIC. The estimated time of arrival (ETA) over position 060° East was given as 23:58.  About 23:45 the master fire warning alarm sounded on the flight deck. Somebody, probably the pilot, inquired where the warning had come from and received the reply that it had come from the main deck cargo. The pilot then asked that the check list be read. Some 30 seconds later somebody on the flight deck uttered an oath.  The pilot called Mauritius Approach Control at 23:49 and said that they had a smoke problem and were doing an emergency descent to FL140. The approach controller gave clearance for the descent and the pilot asked that the fire services be alerted. The controller asked if full emergency services were required to which the pilot replied in the affirmative. At 23:51 the approach controller asked the pilot for his actual position. The pilot replied: ""Now we have lost a lot of electrics, we haven't got anything on the aircraft now"". At 23:52 the approach controller asked for an ETA at Plaisance and was given the time of 00:30. At 23:52:50 the pilot made an inadvertent transmission when he said to the senior flight engineer: ""Hey Joe, shut down the oxygen left"". From this time until 00:01:34 there was a period of silence lasting 8 minutes and 44 seconds. From 00:01:34 until 00:02:14 the pilot inadvertently transmitted instructions, apparently to the senior flight engineer, in an excited tone of voice. Most of the phrases are unintelligible. At 00:02:43 the pilot gave a distance report as 65 nautical miles. This was understood by the approach controller to be the distance to the airport. In fact it was the distance to the next waypoint, Xagal. The distance to the airport at that point was approximately 145 nautical miles. At 00:02:50 the approach controller recleared the flight to FL50 and at 00:03:00 gave information on the actual weather conditions at Plaisance Airport, which the pilot acknowledged. When the approach controller asked the pilot at 00:03: 43 which runway he intended to use he replied one three but was corrected when the controller asked him to confirm one four. At 00:03:56 the controller cleared the flight for a direct approach to the Flic-en-Flac (FF) non-directional beacon and requested the pilot to report on approaching FL50. At 00:04:02 the pilot said: ""Kay"". From 00:08:00 to 00:30:00 the approach controller called the aircraft repeatedly but there was no reply. The aircraft crashed into the Indian Ocean at a position determined to be about 134 nautical miles North-East of Plaisance Airport. The accident occurred at night, in darkness, at about 00:07 UTC. The local time was 04:07.  Within a few days drifting pieces of wreckage were found, but it took until January 28th, 1988 for the main wreckage field to be found on the Ocean floor, at a depth of 4400 meters. The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on 6 Jan. 1989.  PROBABLE CAUSE: Fire of an unknown origin had possibly: 1) incapacitated the crew; 2) caused disorientation of the crew due to thick smoke; 3) caused crew distraction; 4) weakened the aircraft structure, causing an in-flight break-up.; 5) burned through several control cables; 6) caused loss of control due to deformation of the aircraft fuselage."
Thursday 28 July 2011,04:10,Boeing 747-48EF,Asiana Airlines,28752,2,"130 km W off Jeju, South Korea [East China Sea] - 
	   Pacific Ocean",En route,Cargo,Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI),Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG/ZSPD),"A Boeing 747-400F cargo plane, HL7604, was destroyed when it crashed into the sea off Jeju, South Korea. Both pilots were killed in the accident. Asiana Airlines flight 991 departed Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN) at 03:05 on a cargo flight to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG), China. At 03:51, at FL340, the copilot made initial contact with Shanghai Area Control Center (ACC).  Three minutes later the copilot radioed, ""Shanghai control, Shanghai control, AAR991 request emergency descent, emergency, declare emergency due to fire main deck. Request descent, and descent to one-zero thousand."" This request was approved. In subsequent communication the copilot stated that they wanted to divert back to Jeju with a descent to FL100.  At 04:00, Shanghai Control instructed AAR991 to contact Incheon ACC for a radar vector to Jeju, however, AAR991 stated that it was unable to contact on that frequency. The radar data of Incheon ACC shows that at 04:01, AAR991 was flying at 8,200 ft at a ground speed of 404 kt on a heading of 033°, and after this, AAR991's altitude, ground speed, and heading changed inconsistently. At 04:02 contact was transferred to Fukuoka ACC. The flight then radioed: ""Fukuoka AAR991 mayday mayday mayday, we have cargo fire, request direct to Jeju please."" With Fukuoka ACC failing to respond, the crew contacted Shanghai ACC again. Korean Air flight KE886 was used to relay radar vectors and descent instructions from Incheon ACC. The captain then reported rudder control problems to KE886. Control problems appeared to worsen as the captain radioed: ""Rudder control... flight control, all are not working."" at 04:09.  Meanwhile the first officer managed to change frequencies to Jeju ACC, stating: ""We have heavy vibration on the airplane, may need to make an emergency landing, emergency ditching."". Last contact was at 04:10 when the first officer radioed: ""Altitude control is not available due to heavy vibration, going to ditch... ah."" According to radar data the altitude at that time was about 10.000 feet. The airplane then entered a high speed descent and struck the surface of the sea and broke up. The wreckage sank to a depth of about 85 metres.  The plane carried 58 tonnes of cargo, including 0.4 tonnes of potentially risky materials such as lithium batteries, paint, amino acid solution and synthetic resin.  Causes: The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines the cause of this accident as follows: A fire developed on or near the pallets containing dangerous goods but no physical evidence of the cause of the fire was found. The fire rapidly escalated into a large uncontained fire, and this caused some portions of the fuselage to separate from the aircraft in midair, thereby resulting in the crash.  Contributing Factors 1. Flammable materials like photo-resist (Class 3) were loaded in position ML, and flammable materials like paint, photo-resist, corrosive liquid, and lithium-ion batteries (Class 9) were loaded on one pallet in position PR. 2. It was difficult to contain a large scale of fire only by the fire suppression system of a Class E cargo compartment that was not equipped with an active fire suppression system."

	   Pacific Ocean",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Lima-Jorge Chávez International Airport (LIM/SPIM),Santiago-Arturo Merino Benitez Airport (SCL/SCEL),"AeroPeru Flight 603, a Boeing 757-200, crashed into the sea off Lima, Peru, killing all 70 occupants. The aircraft performed a regular passenger service from Lima, Peru to Santiago, Chile. The flight took off from runway 15 at Lima Airport at 00:42 hours local time (05:42 UTC).  While climbing through an altitude of approximately 200-300 ft, the pilots noted that the airspeed and altitude indications were too low. In calm winds, the windshear warning suddenly sounded three times. The flight crew then declared an emergency. The crew also started to receive rudder ratio and mach speed trim warnings, which were repeated throughout the flight, distracting their attention and adding to the problem of multiple alarms and warnings which saturated and bewildered them, creating confusion and chaos. At 00:53 the flight contacted the Departure controller again, eight minutes after the initial call, reporting they ""request vectors from now on"". By then the aircraft had climbed over sea and the flight crew were attempting to turn back, while trying to manage all conflicting warnings. At 00:55:07, the crew radioed: ""You're going to have to help us with altitudes and speed if that's possible.""  And from that moment until the end, the stick shaker, overspeed and ""too low  terrain"" alarms began to sound. This caused confusion and the copilot said to the captain: ""...right now we're stalling."" The captain disagreed: ""we're not stalling. it's fictitious, it's fictitious"". Referring to the stick shaker, the copilot replies ""... how can we not be stalling?"". At 01:04 the flight crew was attempting to maintain 4000 feet, however one minute later they start a measured and continuous descent. The aircraft kept descending and impacted the water with the left wing and no. 1 engine at a 10 degrees angle, at a speed of 260 knots. The aircraft pulled up to about 300 feet and flew for another 17 seconds. It then rolled inverted and crashed. The captain's airspeed indicated 450 knots and altitude 9500 feet.  Investigation results showed that the aircraft's three static ports on the left side were obstructed by masking tape. The tape had been applied before washing and polishing of the aircraft prior to the accident flight.  PROBABLE PRINCIPAL CAUSE :  ERROR OF THE MAINTENANCE STAFF INCLUDING THE CREW   It can be deduced from the investigation carried out that the maintenance staff did not remove the protective adhesive tape from the static ports. This tape was not detected during the various phases of the aircraft's release to the line mechanic, its transfer to the passenger boarding apron and, lastly, the inspection by the crew responsible for the flight (the walk-around or pre-flight check), which was carried out by the pilot-in-command, [name], according to the mechanic responsible for the aircraft on the day of the accident.   CONTRIBUTING CAUSES  b.1) PERSONAL ERROR OF THE CREW  The pilot-in-command, Mr [name], made a personal error by not complying with the procedure for GPWS alarms and not noticing the readings of the radio altimeters in order to discard everything which he believed to be fictitious.  b.2) PERSONAL ERROR INCLUDING THE CREW   The co-pilot, Mr [name], made a personal error by not being more insistent, assertive and convincing in alerting the pilot-in-command much more emphatically to the ground proximity alarms."

The hijackers were on a suicide mission and had received orders to take over control of the aircraft and to fly the planes into specified targets.  United Airlines Flight 175 departed Boston-Logan for Los Angeles at 08:14. The aircraft was hijacked by five terrorists. The hijackers took over control, reportedly switched off the transponder and changed course to New York. At 09:03 the aircraft was flown into the Southeast side of the 110-story New York WTC South tower in a sharp left wing low attitude, crashed and exploded into the 78th through 84th floors. According to an FAA study, N612UA struck the WTC at a speed of 586 mph; an MIT study however determined the plane was probably traveling at 537 mph.  The massive fire weakened the tower structure on these floors and the tower collapsed at 09:59. Most of the office workers below the 78th floor were able to evacuate the tower on time before the collapse. Seventeen minutes before Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, the WTC North Tower had been hit by an American Airlines Boeing 767, N334AA. A total of 2,606 people were killed in the World Trade Center buildings, including about 292 on the ground. A precise breakdown of the number casualties relating to Flight 11 (North Tower) and Flight 175 (South Tower) is impossible. It has been estimated that about 1600 people were killed on the North Tower, and about 900 on the South Tower."

The aircraft lost control during a low speed steady-heading sideslip test manoeuvre at FL120. The crew were to end a Steady Heading Sideslip (SHSS) manoeuvre at a 15deg sideslip, but continued to 21deg. at full rudder. The plane rolled rapidly through 360deg and entered a deep stall. As it descended through 8000 feet the captain requested the co-pilot to deploy the anti-spin parachute, which he complied with. The co-pilot however, didn't close the jaws (which connect/disconnect the parachute from the airplane) before chute deployment. The chute thus fell free of the plane. Control was not regained and the aircraft crashed and skidded for about 200 yards through several cornfields.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to adhere to the agreed upon flight test plan for ending the test manoeuvre at the onset of prestall stick shaker, and the flight crew's failure to assure that all required switches were properly positioned for anti-spin chute deployment. A factor which contributed to the accident was the inadequate design of the anti-spin chute system which allowed deployment of the chute with the hydraulic lock switch in the unlocked position. (When in the unlocked position, the hooks clasping the chute shackle to the airframe are open.)"""

	   North Macedonia",Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Skopje Airport (SKP/LWSK),Zürich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH),"Palair Macedonian Airlines flight PMK301 was destroyed when it crashed immediately after takeoff from Skopje Airport, North Macedonia. Fourteen of the 97 occupants survived the accident. The aircraft, a Fokker 100 jet, was leased to Palair by Aircraft Financing and Trading (AFT) of the Netherlands since January 1993. AFT provided route training captains, while Palair provided the first officer or candidate Palair captain and the cabin crew . The aircraft arrived on a scheduled flight from Frankfurt to Skopje at 09:40 hours local time with a 35 minute delay. The new crew arrived at Skopje Airport at approximately 10:30 and they went straight to the aircraft. It was snowing lightly. The temperature was 0° Celsius, dewpoint -1° Celsius. The AFT Director Flight Operations was the pilot-in-command and was sitting in the right seat. He performed the first officer duties and was the pilot not flying (PNF). He was also giving route-instruction. A captain-under-training was sitting in the left seat. He was acting captain and was pilot flying (PF), receiving route-training. The dispatch officer checked both wing leading edges and saw they were not contaminated with ice or snow, but were only wet of melted snow. The Flying Station Engineer subsequently performed the walk around and was accompanied by three Palair ground handling crewmembers. The ground handling crewmembers stated that they had a brief discussion with the FSE about the weather and asked if the aircraft needed de-icing since there was some snow on the right wing inner flap. The FSE replied that de-icing was not necessary and that any deposit would blow off the wing during take off. The total time the aircraft remained on the ground at Skopje Airport was about 1 hour 35 minutes. At 11:05 hours start-up was approved and clearance was given to taxi to holding point runway 34. During taxying, a Yak-42D from Vardar Air, which was standing on the apron, was de-iced. This was the first aircraft that day being de-iced. In the meantime the snowfall had increased to moderate. According to the Cockpit Voice Recorder, no discussion about the weather conditions took place by the pilots. At 11:11 Palair 301 was cleared for take off, the wind was given as 010° with 3 knots. The tower controller stated that the visibility was 900 meters and it was snowing.  The aircraft rotated normally and the PNF then called ""positive"", followed by the call ""gear up"" from the PF, which was confirmed by the PNF. Two seconds after lift off the aircraft experienced heavy vibrations followed by a sudden right bank to approximately 10°, immediately followed by approximately 50° left bank and 55° right bank in sequence within 2 seconds. The roll movements were counteracted by aileron and rudder input. Approximately 10 seconds before impact the PNF called ""deselect"" followed by sounds which were determined to be the auto pilot cavalry charge (twice) followed by the GPWS aural alert, ""sink rate"" (twice). The aircraft right wingtip hit the ground 382 meters beyond the end of the runway with approximately 90° bank, the fuselage was more or less in a horizontal position. The right wing disintegrated towards the wing-fuselage attachment, followed by major impact of the fuselage, which broke up into three major parts, and the impact of the right engine and stabilizer. The right engine separated and subsequently impacted and penetrated the aft fuselage. The stabilizer and the upper part of the vertical tail plane also separated. Witnesses stated that explosions followed shortly after impact and several residual fires broke out on the debris.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Board determined that impact with the ground in a steep right bank shortly after lift off was caused by loss of roll controllability due to contamination of the wings with ice. This situation resulted from an omission to carry out spraying of the aircraft with deicing or anti-icing fluid in meteorological conditions conducive to icing, due to a lack of ice-awareness of the flight crew and the Flying Station Engineer . Contributing factors were a lack of common background and procedures in a difficult multi-sources operational environment."""

With the conditions at the time of takeoff, the aircraft should have reached rotation speed after a ground roll of 850 m(2800 feet). From the flight data recorder it was determined that the aircraft became airborne at 124 knots after a 975 m (3200-foot) roll . The speed increased to 133 knots and then dropped to 124 knots, and the aircraft veered left.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The aircraft stalled on takeoff due to over rotation and frost accretion on the wings."""

Following a PAR approach the airplane landed slightly long on the 9235 feet long runway 11. The aircraft rolled for 1500 to 2000 feet with no thrust reverser or spoiler deployment. A go around was commenced. The plane then rotated abruptly and lifted off the runway with a pitch attitude as high as 45 degrees. The aircraft stalled. The left wing struck the ground and burst into flames. The aircraft became airborne again with portions of the left wing missing. It flew for 650 feet before striking the ground with the right wing, causing it to catch fire. It then bounced once more and disintegrated 500 feet from runway centerline.  Investigation revealed that the crew were very inexperienced (a captain with less than 100 hours in command). The were probably affected by an optical illusion.

At 09:22 the flight was cleared to taxi into position and hold. Takeoff clearance was given a minute later, but the crew delayed the acknowledgment, because the captain thought the clearance was given too soon after a heavy jet aircraft had made its takeoff. Acceleration was normal, but while approaching the V1 speed (156 knots) a loud ""metallic bang"" was heard, followed by a quivering. As rejected takeoff procedures were begun, the airspeed continued to increase to 159 knots. The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normally, but with 2000 feet of runway remaining, the flight crew became aware that the rate of deceleration had decreased and they believed that the aircraft would not be able to stop on the runway. The aircraft was steered to the right and departed the right corner of the runway end. About 100 feet beyond the runway, the left main gear broke through the nonload-bearing tarmac surface and failed. A fire erupted in this area as the aircraft turned to the left, coming to rest 664 feet from the runway end and 40 feet right of the extended centreline in a 11deg left wing low and 1,3deg nose-up attitude.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The sequential failure of two tyres on the left main landing gear and the resultant failure of another tire on the same landing gear at a critical time during the take-off roll.

The aircraft was operating as flight SK933 from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Los Angeles, California, with an en route stop and scheduled crew change at Seattle, Washington, USA. Of the 45 persons aboard the aircraft at the time of the accident, 4 drowned, 11 are missing and presumed dead, 17 were injured, and 13 reported no injuries. The survivors included the captain, the first officer, and the flight engineer. The aircraft was destroyed by impact. The fuselage broke into three pieces, two of which sank in approximately 350 feet of water. The third section including the wings, the forward cabin, and the cockpit floated for a considerable time after the accident. This portion of the aircraft was towed into shallow water and sank approximately 20 hours after the accident. The flight departed from runway 16 at Seattle at 15:46 hours. The first officer was flying the aircraft and the captain was pilot monitoring. The departure and en route part of the flight were uneventful. The aircraft entered a holding pattern at 17:32 for 90 minutes. SK933 was then cleared to descend in preparation for a back course ILS approach to runway 07R, which the approach to be flown  over sea. Since SAS crews were not authorized to execute a back course ILS at Los Angeles, and the crew did not have an approach plate depicting this particular approach. The pilots decided to conduct a VOR approach to runway 07R and reviewed the procedures for this approach. The night was black and featureless, with no ground reference at the time the aircraft was cleared for the approach, at 19:19 hours. The flight crew selected the gear down the nose landing gear safe light did not illuminate, but the main landing gear safe lights were lighted. The nose landing gear unsafe light was not illuminated though. The landing gear was recycled at least one time by the captain and still showed an unsafe condition on the nose gear. The captain the asked the flight engineer to check the circuit breakers on the landing gear lights and to check visually the nose gear down locks. The systems operator checked the circuit breakers from memory and then took off his headset, leaned forward between the pilots to check the gear lights, got the flight manual out and rechecked the circuit breakers. While he was leaning forward between the pilots to check the gear lights, he heard the captain advise the controller that they were having gear trouble and, if it was not resolved by the time they reached minimums, they would pull up and divert to Las Vegas.  After checking the lights, the flight engineer went to the rear of the cockpit, removed the cover plate from the peephole, verified the down and locked position of the nose gear, and called this information to the pilots.  The first officer then saw the drum of the altimeter nearing ""0"". At this time, he attempted to pull up by applying back pressure on the control wheel and adding power. Before he was able to complete these actions the aircraft struck the water. After the aircraft came to a stop, there was water in the cockpit about waist deep. After obtaining flashlights and lifejackets, the crew proceeded into the cabin and supervised the evacuation of the passengers and cabin attendants.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The lack of crew coordination and the inadequate monitoring of the aircraft position in space during a critical phase of an instrument approach which resulted in an unplanned descent into the water. Contributing to this unplanned descent was an apparent unsafe landing gear condition induced by the design of the landing gear indicator lights, and the omission of the minimum crossing altitude at an approach fix depicted on the approach chart."""

Again full right and left rudder were applied and sounds of a snap, a thump and a loud bang were heard when the rudder travelled full right again. The entire vertical tail fin had separated and the Airbus entered an uncontrolled descent from an altitude of about 2500 feet. During this descent both engines separated from the wings coming down within 100 feet of each other near the Newport Avenue / Beach 129th Street crossroads. The aircraft crashed into Beach 131 Street, a Queens residential area.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer as a result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officers unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program. """

The Airbus A300 was to continue to Dubai (DXB) as flight 655. Prior to departure the crew received an enroute clearance to Dubai via the flight planned route A59 and A59W at FL140. The flight took off from runway 21 at 10:17 hours and climbed straight ahead. Two minutes later, the crew reported leaving 3500 feet for FL140 on Airway A59, estimating MOBET at 06:53 UTC (10:23 Iran time). At 10:24:00 the aircraft passed MOBET out of FL120. At 10:24:43 the Airbus was hit by surface-to-air missiles. The tail and one wing broke off as a result of the explosions. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed into the sea.  The missiles were fired by the US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes. It was operating in the area together with the frigates USS Elmer Montgommery and USS John H. Sides. They were to protect other ships in the area. At about the time the Airbus took off, the radar aboard the USS Vincennes picked up a brief IFF mode 2 response, which led to the mistaken identification of the Airbus as a hostile F-14 aircraft. The USS Vincennes issued 7 challenges on the Military Air Distress (MAD) frequency 243 MHz, addressed to 'Iranian aircraft', 'Iranian fighter' or 'Iranian F-14'. These messages were followed by three challenges on the IAD (International Air Defence) radio frequency.  Due to increasing tension in the area - on May 17, 1987 an Iraqi Mirage had attacked USS Stark - all aircraft in the area had to monitor 121.5 Mhz: the International Air Defence - IAD radio frequency. There was no response.  Meanwhile radar operators were monitoring the Aegis screens. They reported that the incoming plane was descending with an increasing speed. In fact, the Airbus was climbing. Considering itself and USS Montgomery under aggression, USS Vincennes took the ultimate decision to launch missiles against the perceived hostile target at 10:24:22. It remains uncertain whether the IR655 flight crew (only able to monitor the IAD, not the MAD frequencies) would have been able to rapidly identify their flight as the subject of the challenges made by the USS Vincennes.  CAUSES: ""The aircraft was perceived as a military aircraft with hostile intentions and was destroyed by two surface-to-air missiles ."""

	   Russia",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO/UUEE),Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG/VHHH),"The aircraft was en route from Moscow to Hong Kong at 10100 m when, approaching the Novokuznetsk reporting point, the captain's daughter entered the cockpit. She was allowed to sit the left-hand seat while the captain demonstrated some autopilot features, using HDG/S and NAV submodes to alter the heading. The captain's son then took the left front seat. The captain intended to demonstrate the same manoeuvre when his son asked if he could turn the control wheel. He then turned the wheel slightly (applying a force of between 8-10 kg) and held it in that position for a few seconds before returning the wheel to the neutral position. The captain then demonstrated the same features as he did to his daughter and ended by using the NAV submode to bring the aircraft back on course. As the autopilot attempted to level the aircraft at its programmed heading, it came in conflict with the inputs from the control wheel which was blocked in a neutral position. Forces on the control wheel increased to 12-13 kg until the torque limiter activated by disconnecting the autopilot servo from the aileron control linkage. The autopilot remained engaged however. The aircraft then started to bank to the right at 2,5deg/sec, reaching 45deg. when the autopilot wasn't able to maintain altitude. The A310 started buffeting, which caught the attention of the captain who told the co-pilot to take control while he was trying to regain his seat. The seat of the co-pilot was fully aft, so it took him an additional 2-3 seconds to get to the control wheel. The bank continued to 90 degrees, the aircraft pitched up steeply with +4,8g accelerations, stalled and entered a spin. Two minutes and six seconds later the aircraft struck the ground.  CONCLUSIONS The A310 disaster was caused by a stall, spin and impact with the ground resulting from a combination of the following factors: 1. The decision by the PIC to allow an unqualified and unauthorized outsider (his son) to occupy his duty station and intervene in the flying of the aeroplane. 2. The execution of demonstration manoeuvres that were not anticipated in the flight plan or flight situation, with the PIC operating the autopilot while not at his duty station. 3. Application by the outsider and the co-pilot of control forces that interfered with the functioning of the roll channel of the autopilot (and are not recommended in the A310 flight manual), thus overriding the autopilot and disconnecting it from the aileron control linkage. 4. The co-pilot and PIC failed to detect the fact that the autopilot had become disconnected from the aileron control linkage, probably because: - The A310 instrumentation has no declutch warning. The provision of signals in accordance with the requirements of Airworthiness Standard NLGS-3, para. 8.2.7.3., and international recommended practices, could have enabled the crew to detect the disengaged autopilot in a timely manner. - The co-pilot and PIC may have been unaware of the peculiarities of the declutching function and the actions to be taken in such a situation because of a lack of appropriate information in the flight manual and crew training programme; - It was difficult for the co-pilot to detect the disengagement of the autopilot by feel, either because of the small forces on his control column or because he took changing forces to be the result of Eldar's actions; - The PIC was away from his position and distracted by the conversation with his daughter. 5. A slight, unintentional further turn of the control wheel(s) following disengagement of the autopilot caused a right roll to develop. 6. The PIC and co-pilot failed to detect the excessive right bank angle, which exceeded operating limits, and were late in re-entering the aircraft control loop because their attention was focussed on determining why the aircraft had banked to the right, a manoeuvre they interpreted as entry into a holding area with either no course line or with a new (false) course line generated on the navigational display. A strong signal indicating that the aeroplane had exceeded the allowable operating bank angle, taking account of the delay in recognizing and assessing the situation and making a decision, could in this situation have attracted the crew's attention and enabled them to detect the bank at an earlier stage. 7. The aeroplane was subjected to buffeting and high angles of attack because the autopilot continued to perform its height-keeping function even after the actuator declutched and as the right roll developed, until the pilot disconnected it by overriding its longitudinal channel. 8. Inappropriate and ineffective action on the part of the co-pilot, who failed to disconnect the autopilot and to push the control column forward when the buffeting occurred and the aeroplane entered an unusual attitude (high angles of attack and pitch). These actions, which caused the aeroplane to stall and spin, could have resulted from: - the presence of an outsider in the left-hand pilot's seat and the resulting delay before the PIC re-entered the aeroplane control loop; - the less-than-optimum working posture of the co-pilot, whose seat was pushed back to its rearmost position; - the occurrence, 2 seconds following the onset of buffeting, of an unintentional pitching up of the aeroplane, which sharply increased the angle of attack and reduced lateral controllability; - unpreparedness of the crew to act in this situation because of lack of appropriate drills in the training programme; - temporary loss of spatial orientation in night conditions."

A fire broke out, killing three occupants. The Mulhouse Flying Club had requested Air France to perform a fly by at their air show at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport on June 26, 1988. Air France prepared a low speed pass with the gear down at 100 feet and the another pass at high speed in clean configuration. While Air France had performed more than twenty low passes since 1987, the altitude of 100 feet was not allowed according to regulations. French air safety regulations imposed a minimum VFR overflight height of 170 feet. The fly by was to be performed using an Airbus A320, an aircraft model that was introduced by launching customer Air France in March 1988. F-GFKC was the third A320 in the fleet and had been delivered on June 23. The flight crew scheduled to perform the demonstration flight were two captains: the head of A320 training subdivision (Pilot Flying) and a captain participating in the placing into service of the A320(Pilot Monitoring). On board the flight were four cabin crew members and 130 passengers. The aircraft took off from nearby Basle-Mulhouse Airport at 14:41 and climbed to 1000 feet agl. The crew started the descent three minutes later and Habsheim was in sight at 450 feet agl. The Pilot Monitoring informed the Pilot Flying that the aircraft was reaching 100 feet at 14:45:14. The descent continued to 50 feet 8 seconds later and further to 30-35 feet. Go-around power was added at 14:45:35. The A320 continued and touched trees approximately 60 meters from the end of runway 34R at 14:45:40 with a 14 degree pitch attitude and engines at 83% N1. The plane sank slowly into the forest and a fire broke out.  PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The Commission believes that the accident resulted from the combination of the following conditions: 1) very low flyover height, lower than surrounding obstacles; 2) speed very slow and reducing to reach maximum possible angle of attack; 3) engine speed at flight idle; 4) late application of go-around power. This combination led to impact of the aircraft with the trees. The Commission believes that if the descent below 100 feet was not deliberate, it may have resulted from failure to take proper account of the visual and aural information intended to give the height of the aircraft."""

The flight remained at 6000 feet until permission was received at 23:06 to descend to 5000 feet. At 23:08 the crew contacted a company flight which had just departed Omaha. This flight reported moderate to light turbulence. About four minutes later the aircraft entered an area of an active squall line. The One-Eleven violently accelerated upward and in a left roll. At this time the right tailplane and the fin failed. The aircraft then pitched nose down and within one or two seconds the right wing failed as well. The plane tumbled down in flames until stabilizing into a flat spinning-attitude before impacting the ground.

As the Boeing 707 was taxiing to runway 27L, Delta Airlines DC-9 N3317L (flight DL379) was landing. After completing the landing roll the crew requested permission to carry out a 180deg turnaround on the runway in order to vacate the runway at the runway 18/36 intersection which they had just passed. Permission was granted, but halfway during the turn the nosewheel slipped off the paved surface and the aircraft moved straight ahead off the runway. The aircraft became stuck in the mud with the tail about 7 feet off the edge of the runway. The controller tried to ascertain that DL379 had cleared the runway and received the reply: ""Yeah, we're in the dirt though"". At 18:39 the controller cleared TW159 for takeoff on the same runway. The first officer, who was at the controls, heard a loud noise from the right side of the plane and experienced a yaw and movement of the flight controls as they passed the DC-9. Assuming that he was at or near V1, he aborted the takeoff. He closed the throttles, applied maximum braking and called for spoilers which the captain extended. Directional control was maintained, but the airplane overran the runway by 225 feet to the brow of a hill. The Boeing became airborne momentarily and contacted the ground approx. 67 feet further on, shearing the main undercarriage. The aircraft slid down the embankment and came to rest straddling a road 421 feet from the runway end. The fuselage upper structure ruptured forward of the wing root and the right wing failed inboard of the no. 4 engine. Investigation revealed that no. 4 engine sustained a compressor stall as it passed the DC-9 due to the jet blast from the idling engines of the Delta plane. The first officer assumed the speed was at or near V1 because the captain failed to announce the V1 speed. The maximum speed attained during the takeoff was 145 knots, which was between VR and V2.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway."""

The aircraft took off from Brussels at 21:52 hours UTC on 12 July 1968 and routine radio reports were received during the en route phase of the flight. At 03:25 UTC (13 July) contact was made with Lagos approach control.  The aircraft gave an ETA at Lagos of 03:55 hours and reported that it was at FL330. A request was then made for the latest Lagos weather and the reply included the following information: wind: 210°/3 kt; visibility: 16 km; cloud: 5/8 stratocumulus 270 m, 7/8 altostratus 2 400 m, temporary thunderstorms, 118 cumulonimbus 2 000 ft; QNH: 1012 mb; temperature 24°.  At 03:27 hours the aircraft reported an ETA overhead Ibadan NDB of 03:44 hours in response to a request for this information from Lagos. One minute later it reported that the Ibadan NDB did not appear to be operating. At 03:36 the aircraft requested descent clearance. It was cleared to Lagos at FL60 and commenced the descent from FL330 at that time. Three minutes later the aircraft reported passing Ibadan and descending through FL275 but since it had reported earlier that the Ibadan NDB seemed not to be radiating, it is not known how the position was determined.  In reply Lagos approach stated that there was no delay in the approach and that the runway in use was 19. At 03:41 hours, when the aircraft was about 50 miles north of Lagos, it was recleared to 2200 ft on a QNH of 1012 mb and told to report field in sight.  Shortly after this interchange the descent was interrupted while the speed decreased to a figure corresponding to the recommended maximum for landing gear extension and this speed was not exceeded for the remainder of the flight. The autopilot was most probably disengaged at this stage of the flight. Subsequent to the speed reduction the rate of descent was re-established to approximately 2000 ft/min and at 03:50 hours the aircraft passed one mile to the east of Lagos Airport whilst on a southerly heading at an altitude of 15000 ft. The aircraft was heard flying over the airport at this time. A procedure turn was made to the south of the airport in the vicinity of the city of Lagos and at its conclusion there was a second interruption in the descent following which the airspeed remained below the maximum for 25° of flap. At 03:54 hours the aircraft passed over the airport northbound at an altitude of 9000 ft maintaining the average rate of descent of 2000 ft/min for a further 2 1/2 minutes. At 03:56 hours a procedure turn was commenced at an altitude of about 5000 ft during which the rate of descent was reduced to 1500 ft/min. The track of the aircraft between its passage over the airport northbound and the commencement of the final procedure turn is almost coincident with the outbound track of the published VOR approach procedure. At 03:57 hours Lagos approach control was informed by the aircraft that it was in the procedure turn and requested to give the wind conditions. In reply control stated that the wind was calm and this was acknowledged.  Shortly afterwards approach control instructed the aircraft to report runway in sight and this was also acknowledged. On completion of the procedure turn at an altitude of 1400 ft (a height above the airport of 1268 ft) the airspeed was reduced from 190 kt to a little less than 160 kt and the rate of descent was reduced to 900 ft/min. The heading was stabilized on 197° M and at 03:59 hours the aircraft asked for the runway lights to be put on maximum brightness. Approach control replied that the runway lights were on low intensity non-variable. A transmitter switch was then heard but there was no subsequent message from the aircraft before it crashed about 8 1/2 miles north of the airport approximately on the extended centre line of the runway. All the occupants were killed and the aircraft caught fire immediately and was burnt out.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by the aircraft descending below its minimum safe altitude for reasons that have not been determined."""

Prior to departing the ramp at 13:25, the crew asked the ground controller about the departure routes being utilized, and he replied that most flights were departing ""... either through a southwest climb or a southeast climb and then back over the top of it... "". The flight departed Miami with an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) clearance at 13:35. A left turn was made after takeoff from runway 27L and circuitous routing was utilized, in conjunction with radar vectors from Miami Departure Control, to avoid areas of anticipated turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity. A similar departure pattern had been previously flown by another flight. Subsequently, while maintaining 5,000 feet and a heading of 300 degrees, Flight 705 requested clearance to climb to a higher altitude. Following a discussion between the flight and the radar departure controller about the storm activity, and while clearance to climb was being coordinated with the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), the flight advised ""Ah-h we're in the clear now. We can see it out ahead ... looks pretty bad."" At 13:43, Flight 705 was cleared to climb to FL250. They responded, ""OK ahhh, we'll make a left turn about thirty degrees here and climb..."" The controller asked if 270 degrees was their selected climbout heading, and they replied that this would take them ""... out in the open again..."" Accordingly, clearance was granted. Following some discussion about the severity of the turbulence, which was described as moderate to heavy, the flight advised, ""OK, you better run the rest of them off the other way then."" At 13:45 radar service was terminated and control of Flight 705 was transferred to Miami ARTCC. When the flight did not establish radio communication with ARTCC on the initial frequency, Departure Control provided a secondary frequency, and instructed the flight to turn to a heading of 360 degrees which was acknowledged. When Miami ARTCC requested position and altitude, the flight replied, ""We're just out of seventeen five (17,500 feet) and standby on the DME one."" At 13:47:25 the altitude began increasing with a rate of climb gradually increasing to approximately 9,000 feet per minute at 13:47:38. Following this the rate of climb decreased through zero at 13:47:47 when the altitude peaked momentarily at 19,285 feet. During this climb the airspeed decreased from 270 to 215 knots and as the peak altitude was approached, the vertical accelerations changed rapidly from 1G to about -2G. In the next seven seconds the negative acceleration continued to increase at a slower rate, with rapid fluctuations, to a mean value of about -2.8G, while altitude was lost at an increasing rate. As the descent continued with rapidly increasing airspeed, the acceleration trace went from the high negative peak to 1.5G, where it reversed again.  Below 10,000 feet a severe in-flight breakup of the forward fuselage occurred. The main failures in both wings and horizontal stabilizers were in a downward direction, and virtually symmetrical. The forward fuselage broke upward and the vertical stabilizer failed to the left. All four engines generally separated upward and outboard. The debris fell in unpopulated area of the Everglades National Park, 37 miles west-southwest of Miami International Airport.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The unfavourable interaction of severe vertical air drafts and large longitudinal control displacements resulting in a longitudinal ""upset"" from which a successful recovery was not made."""

About 18:55, when the flight was about 27 miles southeast of the Greater Cincinnati Airport, radar traffic control was effected by Cincinnati Approach Control. Subsequent descent clearances were issued to the flight and at 18:57 flight 383 reported: ""...out of five for four and how about a control VFR, we have the airport."" The Approach Controller replied: ""... continue to the airport and cleared for a visual approach to runway one eight, precip lying just to the west boundary of the airport and its ... southbound."" The crew acknowledged the clearance and the controller cleared the flight to descend to 2,000 feet at their discretion. At 18:58 Approach Control advised the flight that its radar position was six miles southeast of the airport and instructed them to change to the Cincinnati tower frequency. One minute later the tower controller cleared the flight to land. During the approach the visibility at the airport deteriorated as it began to rain. The tower controller reported: ""American three eighty three we are beginning to pickup a little rain right now."" At 19:01:14 the tower asked: ""American three eighty three you still got the runway Okay?"" To which the crew replied ""Ah just barely we'll ah pickup the ILS here"".

The cockpit voice recordings indicate noises suggestive of the cockpit door being broken in, along with a reasonable amount of screaming and cursing. No noises are heard from within the cockpit to indicate any of the three occupants were conscious. The autopilot was then disconnected, possibly due to a pitch input by someone entering the cockpit and trying to control the aircraft.

Ground temperatures were in the high 35 degree Celsius and the air conditioning packs, which are located directly beneath the center wing tank and generate heat when they are operating, had been running continuously since the airplane's previous flight, including about 40 minutes on the ground. At 14:48, some 27 minutes before scheduled departure time, fuel vapours in the center wing tank probably ignited, causing an explosion. A fire erupted in the cabin, killing a flight attendant and injuring 6 others. Eighteen minutes later, the fire caused the right wing tank to explode. The fire was put out in an hour, but by then the aircraft had been gutted by the fire.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""An explosion of the center wing tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of the ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but the most likely source was an explosion originating at the center wing tank pump as a result of running the pump in the presence of metal shavings and a fuel/air mixture."""

	   Russia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO/UUEE),Perm Airport (PEE/USPP),"Aeroflot-Nord flight 821 took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport at 21:13 hours on a domestic flight to Perm, Russia. Contact with the flight was lost while the airplane was at 3600 feet in ""difficult weather conditions"", according to Aeroflot officials. The plane came down on the outskirts of the city, hitting the ground just a few hundred yards from small wooden houses and apartment buildings. Investigation revealed that the pilot lost spatial orientation during the night-time approach through clouds. This led to a banking of the plane onto its left wing, and its entering into an intensive descent and collision with the ground. The pilot was not familiar with the attitude indicator (ADI) used on Western jets, compared to those of Russian jets. Also, an unspecified amount of alcohol was detected in the pilot's body, and he was overworked.  The immediate cause of the accident was spatial disorientation of the crew, especially the Captain who was the pilot flying at the final stage of the flight, which led to the left flip-over, a steep descent and the crash of the aircraft. The spatial disorientation was experienced during the night time operation in clouds, with both autopilot and autothrottle disengaged. Contributing to the development of the spatial disorientation and failure to recover from it was a lack of proficiency in aircraft handling, crew resource management and of skills associated with upset recovery using ""western""-type attitude indications that are found on foreign and modern Russian-made aircraft. This type of indication differs from the one used on aircraft types previously flown by the crew (Tupolev 134, Antonov 2). The systemic cause of the accident was insufficient management by the airline of flight and maintenance operations of the Boeing 737 type of aircraft. These deficiencies in the aircraft maintenance also revealed through safety inspections conducted by the Russian Transport Oversight Authority and the Russian CAA after the accident. Deficiencies in the aircraft maintenance led to a situation when flights were performed for a long time with a throttle stagger [difference in trim of right and left engines, when matching throttle position leads to a split in engine thrust while matching thrust leads to different throttle position] that exceeded the limitations in the AMM and when the maintenance staff did not follow the AMM recommended troubleshooting procedures. The need to manage the throttle stagger during the approach increased crew workload. The forensic medical examination performed in the State Healthcare Center of Special Status Perm Regional Forensic Expertise Bureau confirmed the presence of ethyl alcohol in the Captains body before his death. The captains recent work schedule during the time period before the accident was conducive to fatigue and did not comply with national regulations."
Wednesday 25 February 2009,10:26,Boeing 737-8F2,THY Turkish Airlines,,9,"1,5 km N of Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS) - 
	   Netherlands",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Istanbul-Atatürk International Airport (IST/LTBA),Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM),"Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800, departed Istanbul-Atatürk International Airport (IST) for a flight to Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS), The Netherlands. The flight crew consisted of three pilots: a line training captain who occupied the left seat, a first officer under line training in the right seat and an additional first officer who occupied the flight deck jump seat. The first officer under line training was the pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight was descending for Schiphol and passed overhead Flevoland at about 8500 ft. At that time the aural landing gear warning sounded. The aircraft continued and was then directed by Air Traffic Control towards runway 18R for an ILS approach and landing. The standard procedure for runway 18R prescribes that the aircraft is lined up at least 8 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glidepath is then approached and intercepted from below. Lining up at a distance between 5 and 8 NM is allowed when permitted by ATC.  Flight 1951 was vectored for a line up at approximately 6 NM at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glide slope was now approached from above. The crew performed the approach with one of the two autopilot and autothrottle engaged.  The landing gear was selected down and flaps 15 were set. While descending through 1950 feet, the radio altimeter value suddenly changed to -8 feet. And again the aural landing gear warning sounded. This could be seen on the captains (left-hand) primary flight display. The first officers (right-hand) primary flight display, by contrast, indicated the correct height, as provided by the right-hand system. The left hand radio altimeter system, however, categorised the erroneous altitude reading as a correct one, and did not record any error. In turn, this meant that it was the erroneous altitude reading that was used by various aircraft systems, including the autothrottle. The crew were unaware of this, and could not have known about it. The manuals for use during the flight did not contain any procedures for errors in the radio altimeter system. In addition, the training that the pilots had undergone did not include any detailed system information that would have allowed them to understand the significance of the problem. When the aircraft started to follow the glidepath because of the incorrect altitude reading, the autothrottle moved into the retard flare mode. This mode is normally only activated in the final phase of the landing, below 27 feet. This was possible because the other preconditions had also been met, including flaps at (minimum) position 15. The thrust from both engines was accordingly reduced to a minimum value (approach idle). This mode was shown on the primary flight displays as RETARD. However, the right-hand autopilot, which was activated, was receiving the correct altitude from the right-hand radio altimeter system. Thus the autopilot attempted to keep the aircraft flying on the glide path for as long as possible. This meant that the aircrafts nose continued to rise, creating an increasing angle of attack of the wings. This was necessary in order to maintain the same lift as the airspeed reduced. In the first instance, the pilots only indication that the autothrottle would no longer maintain the pre-selected speed of 144 knots was the RETARD display. When the speed fell below this value at a height of 750 feet, they would have been able to see this on the airspeed indicator on the primary flight displays. When subsequently, the airspeed reached 126 knots, the frame of the airspeed indicator also changed colour and started to flash. The artificial horizon also showed that the nose attitude of the aircraft was becoming far too high. The cockpit crew did not respond to these indications and warnings. The reduction in speed and excessively high pitch attitude of the aircraft were not recognised until the approach to stall warning (stick shaker) went off at an altitude of 460 feet.  The first officer responded immediately to the stick shaker by pushing the control column forward and also pushing the throttle levers forward. The captain however, also responded to the stick shaker commencing by taking over control. Assumingly the result of this was that the first officers selection of thrust was interrupted. The result of this was that the autothrottle, which was not yet switched off, immediately pulled the throttle levers back again to the position where the engines were not providing any significant thrust. Once the captain had taken over control, the autothrottle was disconnected, but no thrust was selected at that point. Nine seconds after the commencement of the first approach to stall warning, the throttle levers were pushed fully forward, but at that point the aircraft had already stalled and the height remaining, of about 350 feet, was insufficient for a recovery. According to the last recorded data of the digital flight data recorder the aircraft was in a 22° ANU and 10° Left Wing Down (LWD) position at the moment of impact. The airplane impacted farmland. The horizontal stabilizer and both main landing gear legs were separated from the aircraft and located near the initial impact point. The left and right engines had detached from the aircraft. The aft fuselage, with vertical stabilizer, was broken circumferentially forward of the aft passenger doors and had sustained significant damage. The fuselage had ruptured at the right side forward of the wings. The forward fuselage section, which contained the cockpit and seat rows 1 to 7, had been significantly disrupted. The rear fuselage section was broken circumferentially around row 28.  The Dutch Safety Board has reached the following main conclusion: During the accident flight, while executing the approach by means of the instrument landing system with the right autopilot engaged, the left radio altimeter system showed an incorrect height of -8 feet on the left primary flight display. This incorrect value of -8 feet resulted in activation of the retard flare mode of the autothrottle, whereby the thrust of both engines was reduced to a minimal value (approach idle) in preparation for the last phase of the landing. Due to the approach heading and altitude provided to the crew by air traffic control, the localizer signal was intercepted at 5.5 NM from the runway threshold with the result that the glide slope had to be intercepted from above. This obscured the fact that the autothrottle had entered the retard flare mode. In addition, it increased the crews workload. When the aircraft passed 1000 feet height, the approach was not stabilised so the crew should have initiated a go around. The right autopilot (using data from the right radio altimeter) followed the glide slope signal. As the airspeed continued to drop, the aircrafts pitch attitude kept increasing. The crew failed to recognise the airspeed decay and the pitch increase until the moment the stick shaker was activated. Subsequently the approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash."

The initial climb passed through an area of thunderstorms, so the captain elected to keep the seat belt sign on. As the aircraft was climbing, between 22,000 and 23,000 feet, explosive decompression was experienced. An emergency was declared at approximately 02:20 HST. The captain initiated a 180-degree left turn to avoid a thunderstorm and proceeded toward HNL. The forward lower lobe cargo door had opened in flight, taking with it a large portion of the forward right side of the cabin fuselage. The starboard side engines (no.3 and 4) were damaged and had to be shut down. Parts of the leading and trailing edge flaps where also damaged resulting in the crew electing to use only 10-degrees trailing edge flaps for landing (a non-normal configuration). This resulted in the aircraft having to land at a higher speed than it would under normal conditions. The aircraft was cleared to land at HNL runway 8L. At 02:34 HST, Honolulu tower was notified by the flight crew that the airplane was stopped and an emergency evacuation had commenced on the runway. During the decompression, nine passengers had been ejected from the airplane and lost at sea.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The sudden opening of the forward lower lobe cargo door in flight and the subsequent explosive decompression. The door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches toward the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. Contributing to the cause of the accident was a deficiency in the design of the cargo door locking mechanisms, which made them susceptible to deformation, allowing the door to become unlatched after being properly latched and locked. Also contributing to the accident was a lack of timely corrective actions by Boeing and the FAA following a 1987 cargo door opening incident on a Pan Am B-747."""

All seven crew members were killed in the accident. The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment. The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai.  According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each. It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion. The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 07:45Z and arrived into Bagram at 09:23Z (13:53 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours.   The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai.  At about 14:27 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram. There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure. Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 15:14. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 15:26. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right.   An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAPs aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""National Airlines inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads, which resulted in the loadmasters improper restraint of the cargo, which moved aft and damaged hydraulic systems Nos. 1 and 2 and horizontal stabilizer drive mechanism components, rendering the airplane uncontrollable. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administrations inadequate oversight of National Airlines handling of special cargo loads."""

At 21:34, while descending to FL200, the crew contacted Cali Approach. The aircraft was 63nm out of Cali VOR (which is 8nm South of the airport)) at the time. Cali cleared the flight for a direct Cali VOR approach and report at Tulua VOR. Followed one minute later by a clearance for a straight in VOR DME approach to runway 19 (the Rozo 1 arrival). The crew then tried to select the Rozo NDB (Non Directional Beacon) on the Flight Management Computer (FMC). Because their Jeppesen approach plates showed 'R' as the code for Rozo, the crew selected this option. But 'R' in the FMC database meant Romeo. Romeo is a navaid 150nm from Rozo, but has the same frequency. The aircraft had just passed Tulua VOR when it started a turn to the left (towards Romeo). This turn caused some confusion in the cockpit since Rozo 1 was to be a straight in approach. 87 Seconds after commencing the turn, the crew activated Heading Select (HDG SEL), which disengaged LNAV and started a right turn. The left turn brought the B757 over mountainous terrain, so a Ground Proximity (GPWS) warning sounded. With increased engine power and nose-up the crew tried to climb. The spoilers were still activated however. The stick shaker then activated and the aircraft crashed into a mountain at about 8900 feet (Cali field elevation being 3153 feet).  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Aeronautica Civil determines that the probable causes of this accident were:  1. The flight crew's failure to adequately plan and execute the approach to runway 19 at SKCL and their inadequate use of automation;  2. Failure of the flight crew to discontinue the approach into Cali, despite numerous cues alerting them of the inadvisability of continuing the approach; 3. The lack of situational awareness of the flight crew regarding vertical navigation, proximity to terrain, and the relative location of critical radio aids;  4. Failure of the flight crew to revert to basic radio navigation at the time when the FMS-assisted navigation became confusing and demanded an excessive workload in a critical phase of the flight.  Contributing to the cause of the accident were:  1. The flight crew's ongoing efforts to expedite their approach and landing in order to avoid potential delays;  2. The flight crew's execution of the GPWS escape manoeuvre while the speed brakes remained deployed;  3. FMS logic that dropped all intermediate fixes from the display(s) in the event of execution of a direct routing;  4. FMS-generated navigational information that used a different naming convention from that published in navigational charts."""

As the Canadair Regional Jet approached Brest, the crew were cleared for a runway 26L approach. Runway 26L is a 3100 m long ILS equipped runway. During the approach the airplane deviated to the left of the centreline due to gradually shifting winds. At first the aircraft was above the glideslope, but then descended below the glideslope. As they further descended below the glideslope (25 seconds before impact), the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) began to sound. Engine power was added, but it was too late.

All occupants, except for the captain were able to evacuate before the aircraft caught fire. The co-pilot and two passengers were injured.  PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The causes of the accident are as follows: - neglecting to select the APPR mode at the start of the approach, which led to non-capture of the localizer then of the glide slope; - partial detection of flight path deviations, due to the crews focusing on vertical navigation then on horizontal navigation; - continuing a non-stabilised approach down to the decision altitude.

The Convair contacted some treetops, banked 10-15deg and crashed 1800 m from the point of lift-off.  PROBABLE CAUSE: During a 3-engine take-off the aircraft entered an uncontrollable attitude with increased drag and decreased indicated airspeed owing to the following combined circumstances: - Unexpected, early loss of external visual references after lift off. During transition from visual to instrument flying the pilot lost directional control, this again resulting in increased drag due to yaw. The presence of a temperature inversion reducing thrust and indicated airspeed. - The presence of wind shear causing further decrease of indicated airspeed, which resulted in large drag increase."

It had been written up by crew members eight times previously. On the day of the accident the maintenance crewman, unaware of the previous problems, checked the radar. It seemed to be working, so it was signed off as ""Ops Check Okay"".  Shortly after takeoff from McGuire AFB, the crew noticed that the radar was inoperative. Since severe weather was not forecast, they elected to continue to Mildenhall, UK. Two hours after takeoff, British forecasters issued a SIGMET for ""Moderate to occasional severe clear air turbulence from FL240 to FL400"", but the crew never got this report. Four hours after takeoff the crew updates the weather forecast. They receive a weather forecast of ""3/8 at 3000 feet, 4/8 at 4000 feet with an intermittent condition of wind 030/12 gusting 22, visibility five miles in thunderstorms, 2/8 at 2000 feet 5/8 at 2500 feet"". The crew then attempted to get an update one hour from Mildenhall, but was unable to contact the base. Another station reported ""4/8 Thunderstorms tops to FL260"". During the enroute decent they entered the clouds. At FL150, they requested vectors around the weather. Because the primary radar was inoperative, the controller advised that he would have difficulty providing avoidance vectors. The aircraft then entered the leading edge of a very strong line of thunderstorm cells. One estimate indicated they encountered a 100 mph downward vertical airshaft. The right wing had failed, followed quickly by the upper half of the vertical stabilizer, and the four engines."

	   France",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Paris-Orly Airport (ORY/LFPO),London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL),"On Sunday March 3, 1974 flight TK981 departed Istanbul for a flight to Paris and London. The DC-10 landed at Paris-Orly at 11:02 and taxied to stand A2. There were 167 passengers on board, of whom 50 disembarked. The aircraft was refueled and baggage was loaded onto the plane. The planned turnaround time of one hour was delayed by 30 minutes. An additional 216 passengers embarked. Most of the passengers were booked on this flight because of a strike at British Airways. The door of the aft cargo compartment on the left-hand side was closed at about 11:35. When all preparations were complete the flight received permission to taxi to runway 08 at 12:24. Four minutes later the crew were cleared to line up for departure and were cleared for departure route 181 and an initial climb to flight level 40. The aircraft took off at approximately 12:30 and was cleared by Orly Departure to climb to FL60, which was reached at 12:34. The North Area Control Centre then cleared TK981 further to FL230. Three or four seconds before 12:40:00 hours, the noise of decompression was heard and the co-pilot said: ""the fuselage has burst"" and the pressurization aural warning sounded. This was caused by the opening and separation of the aft left-hand cargo door. The pressure difference in the cargo bay and passenger cabin, the floor above the cargo door partly collapsed. Two occupied tripe seat units were ejected from the aircraft. All the horizontal stabilizer and elevator control cables routed beneath the floor of the DC-10 and were thus also severely disrupted. Also the no. 2 engine power was lost almost completely. The aircraft turned 9 deg to the left and pitched nose down. The nose-down attitude increased rapidly to -20 deg. Although the no. 1 and 3 engines were throttled back the speed increased to 360 kts. The pitch attitude then progressively increased to -4 degrees and the speed became steady at 430 kts (800 km/h). At a left bank of 17 degrees the DC-10 crashed into the forest of Ermenonville, 37 km NE of Paris.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was the result of the ejection in flight of the aft cargo door on the left-hand side: the sudden depressurization which followed led to the disruption of the floor structure, causing six passengers and parts of the aircraft to be ejected, rendering No.2 engine inoperative and impairing the flight controls (tail surfaces) so that it was impossible for the crew to regain control of the aircraft. The underlying factor in the sequence of events leading to the accident was the incorrect engagement of the door latching mechanism before take-off. The characteristics of the design of the mechanism made it possible for the vent door to be apparently closed and the cargo door apparently locked when in fact the latches were not fully closed and the lock pins were not in place. It should be noted, however that a view port was provided so that there could be a visual check of the engagement of the lock pins. This defective closing of the door resulted from a combination of various factors: - incomplete application of Service Bulletin 52-37; - incorrect modifications and adjustments which led, in particular, to insufficient protrusion of the lock pins and to the switching off of the flight deck visual warning light before the door was locked; - the circumstances of the closure of the door during the stop at Orly, and, in particular, the absence of any visual inspection, through the viewport to verify that the lock pins were effectively engaged, although at the time of the accident inspection was rendered difficult by the inadequate diameter of the view port.  Finally, although there was apparent redundancy of the flight control systems, the fact that the pressure relief vents between the cargo compartment and the passenger cabin were inadequate and that all the flight control cables were routed beneath the floor placed the aircraft in grave danger in the case of any sudden depressurization causing substantial damage to that part of the structure.  All these risks had already become evident, nineteen months earlier, at the time of the Windsor accident, but no efficacious corrective action had followed."" (Aircraft Accident Report 8/76)"

The aircraft was cleared for a takeoff from runway 35L, 27 minutes after having been de-iced. On takeoff, the DC-9 over rotated. The aircraft sank back and the left wing struck the ground, causing it to separate from the fuselage. The left side of the cockpit and forward fuselage struck the ground next and the aircraft continued to skid inverted.  Of the 82 occupants, 28 lost their lives.  Both pilots were relatively inexperienced in DC-9 operations. The captain had 166 hours on type, of which 33 as captain; and the first officer just had 36 hours on type.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to have the airplane de-iced a second time after delay before take-off that led to upper wing surface contamination and a loss of control during rapid take-off rotation by the first officer.

Saturday 2 May 1970,15:49,McDonnell Douglas DC-9-33CF,"ALM Antillean Airlines, lsf Overseas National Airways - ONA",2505,23,"48 km ENE off St. Croix, Virgin Islands [Caribbean Sea] - 
	   Atlantic Ocean",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)",Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM/TNCM),"ALM flight 980, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-33CF, ditched into the Caribbean Sea after running out of fuel. Forty of the 63 occupants survived the accident. The aircraft was being operated under terms of a lease agreement by Overseas National Airways (ONA) on behalf of ALM - Antillean Airlines. Flight 980 was a regular service from New York-JFK International Airport to Juliana Airport on the island of St. Maarten. Prior to departure the captain calculated that the flight would burn 21000 pounds of fuel. The total amount of fuel on board was 28900 pounds, which translated to an endurance of 4 hours and 34 minutes.  Bulletins received by the captain on the morning of the flight established a new company requirement for fuel planning purposes. The minimum estimated fuel on arrival at destination (EFA) for a nonstop flight to St. Maarten was established as 7000 pounds, which meant the aircraft's fuel exceeded the planned requirements by 900 pounds.   Flight to St. Maarten  The flight left the terminal at 11:02 hours local time and departed on runway 13R at 11:14. At the time power was applied for takeoff, the fuel totalizer read 28450 pounds. The aircraft climbed to the initial cruising altitude of FL290.  At 13:36 the aircraft descended to FL270 followed by a descent to FL250 due to turbulence. At 14:24, the flight passed Guava Intersection, approximately 211 miles north of St. Maarten, with 8600 pounds of fuel on board. The captain estimated that they would arrive at St. Maarten at 15:00 with 6000 pounds of fuel. Shortly after ALM 980 was given a final descent clearance to 10000 feet, San Juan Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) advised that the St. Maarten weather was below landing minimums. The captain requested a repeat of that information and then asked for clearance to San Juan at FL210. At 14:45, the flight diverted for San Juan. However, during the next five minutes, Juliana Tower at St. Maarten advised the flight that the weather had improved to an estimated ceiling of 1000 feet broken, 5000 feet overcast and 4 to 5 miles visibility in rain. With these weather conditions, flight below 1000 feet presumably could be accomplished by visual reference to the ground. The flight was given a new clearance to St. Maarten at 14:51, with permission to descend to 10000 feet at pilot's discretion. The captain noted at this point that 5800 pounds of fuel remained, and estimated that they could arrive at the ramp at St. Maarten at 15:05 with 4400 pounds of fuel. ALM 980 was cleared to descend to 6000 feet, and subsequently cleared for an approach to Juliana Airport at approximately 15:00. At approximately 15:08, the flight reported level at 2500 feet and the tower controller advised that the weather was 800 feet scattered, estimated ceiling 1000 feet broken, 5000 feet overcast, visibility 2 to 3 miles. The crew commenced the approach at 15:15, and they were cleared to make any turns desired in case of a missed approach. On this approach the crew did not sight the runway in sufficient time to align the aircraft for a landing, and a left turn was made to reposition the aircraft, by visual reference to the ground, for another landing attempt at approximately 15:19. This attempt was also unsuccessful because of poor alignment with the runway. During both of these approaches, the aircraft had been flown with 25° flaps, landing gear down, and 140 knots airspeed. After the second landing attempt was aborted, the captain selected full flaps and maintained 128 to 130 knots airspeed for the third approach. On this occasion, he was successful in aligning the aircraft with the runway, but he was too high and close in to maintain the proper descent profile without reducing power below acceptable limits. The captain stated that during the approaches a moderate rain shower was in the area where he was turning on a base leg, but generally visual contact with the field was maintained. The weather remained relatively unchanged throughout this period. Following the third unsuccessful attempt to land, the captain returned to the St. Maarten NDB and elected to divert to St. Thomas.    Low on fuel  The flight was cleared to St. Thomas via direct route at 4000 feet by the Juliana Tower and, at 15:31 ALM 980 was instructed to contact San Juan ARTCC. The captain testified that during the climb to 4000 feet the fuel gauges and totalizer were erratic, but the totalizer indication stabilized momentarily at 850 pounds while the aircraft was level at 4000 feet.  The captain stated that fuel cross-checks had been made en route, and no discrepancies had been noted until after the departure from St. Maarten. His last recollection of fuel quantity was 3800 pounds, which he testified he had observed when the aircraft was on the downwind leg of the third landing attempt. He testified that after the reading of 850 pounds was observed, the crew concluded that this was an erroneous reading. Radio contact with San Juan ARTCC was established at 15:31. The flight was cleared to FL120, and during the climb requested clearance to St. Croix, which was 11 miles closer. The captain indicated that he used reduced power and airspeed in the climb in an effort to consume less fuel. At 15:38, in response to a request to descend, the flight was cleared to 5000 feet. Less than 1 minute later, the captain reported to the San Juan controller, ""Okay theres a possibility I may have to ditch this aircraft, I am now descending to the water."" He also called the purser forward and told him to prepare the cabin for ditching. During the next several minutes, the crew inquired about their position and the availability of assistance, and they were apprised of the rescue efforts which were already in progress.   Ditching and evacuation  At 15:47, they stated, ""Nine eighty roger... ah... were ditching.""  The captain leveled off momentarily at 500 feet and positioned the aircraft over an established 'swell system.' He then descended in 100-foot increments, pausing momentarily to improve his depth perception. At approximately 20 feet, he lowered 15° flaps and allowed the airspeed to decrease from the previously maintained value of 145 to 150 knots. When the low fuel pressure lights flickered, he selected full flaps. Shortly after this, the engines flamed out, and he flew the aircraft onto the water at approximately 90 knots while maintaining the aircraft body angle at 5-6° noseup. Following impact, the purser and the navigator attempted to open the forward main passenger door, but found it to be jammed and inoperable. These two crewmembers then moved to the galley area where a third crewman, the steward, had already opened the galley exit door and at least one passenger had made her escape through the galley door. The three crewmen attempted to free the raft from the galley equipment which had spilled to the galley floor. They had just been joined by the first officer in this effort when the raft inadvertently inflated. The inflated raft pinned the first officer to the galley bulkhead, and prevented the other crewmembers from entering the main cabin area. These four crewmembers exited through the galley door. The captain was aware of the difficulties in the galley area, and entered the water through the cockpit window. He swam to the left overwing exits, opened them from the outside, and assisted two passengers out of the aircraft. The captain then glanced through the cabin for additional passengers but saw none. Most of the passengers exited through the aft right overwing exit, which was opened by a passenger who was seated next to it. The navigator found an emergency escape slide floating in the water and, with the help of a female passenger, inflated it. The first officer, who had no lifevest, climbed on top of the slide and assumed command of the main group of survivors who gathered around the slide. Belts and ties were used to provide additional handholds for the people. Although none of the five 25-man rafts on board the aircraft was deployed, several rafts were air-dropped at the ditching site. The U.S. Coast Guard Grumman HU-16 Albatross, an amphibian aircraft, dropped two rafts but both fell too far away to be reached. In addition, a Skyvan dropped two rafts in the area. The captain swam to one raft and the navigator reached the other, but neither was able to maneuver his raft back to the main group. Recovery of the survivors by helicopter began approximately one and a half hours after the ditching, and the last survivor, the first officer, was picked up about 1 hour later. Weather in the area during the rescue operation was estimated to be 400 to 500 feet overcast and visibility as low as three-eighths of a mile in rain. The aircraft sank in water more than 5000 feet deep, and was not recovered.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was fuel exhaustion which resulted from continued, unsuccessful attempts to land at St. Maarten until insufficient fuel remained to reach an alternate airport. A contributing factor was the reduced visibility in the approach zone because of rain showers, a condition not reported to the flight. The Board also finds that the probability of survival would have been increased substantially in this accident if there had been better crew coordination prior to and during the ditching."""

However, the airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth because of adverse weather in the area. After 21:00, the first officer notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 23:16 because of Americans company duty time limitation. Another aircraft was arranged and the flight departed at 22:40.    En route and Descent  About 22:54, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew acknowledged this message. About 23:04, the Fort Worth center broadcast an NWS Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory for an area of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The flight crew discussed the weather and the need to expedite the approach. At 23:25:47, the captain stated, ""we got to get over there quick."" About 5 seconds later, the first officer said, ""I dont like that...thats lightning,"" to which the captain replied, ""sure is."" The flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area in sight by 23:26. Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet msl. The flight was transferred to the Memphis ARTCC and at 23:34, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280º at 28 knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L. At 23:36, the captain and first officer discussed American Airlines crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. At 23:39:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final approach course, stating his belief that the airplanes weather radar was ""a lot better"" than the weather radar depiction available in the tower. At 23:39:12, the first officer stated, ""okay, we can...see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make [runway] two two...that storm is moving this way like your radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought."" The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, but the first officer indicated, ""at this point, we really cant make it out. Were gonna have to stay with you as long as possible."" At 23:39:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert, reporting that the centerfield wind was 340º at 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330º at 25 knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010º at 15 knots. The flight crew then requested runway 04R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during landing. At 23:40:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250º for vectors to the runway 04R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had previously been reported by the controller. Between 23:40:46 and 23:41:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 04R. The captain then asked the first officer, ""do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I dont see a runway."" At 23:42:27, the controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving through the area and that the winds were 340º at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. At 23:42:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept ""a short approach"" and ""keep it in tight."" The captain answered, ""yeah, if you see the runway. cause I dont quite see it."" The first officer stated, ""yeah, its right here, see it?"" The captain replied, ""you just point me in the right direction and Ill start slowing down here."" At 23:42:55, the first officer said, ""its going right over the...field."" The first officer then told the controller, ""well we got the airport. Were going between clouds. I think its right off my, uh, three oclock low, about four miles."" The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 04R, and the first officer accepted. At 23:43:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 04R and indicated ""if you lose it, need some help, let me know please."" At 23:43:35, the first officer stated, ""youre comin in. Theres the airport."" Three seconds later, the captain stated, ""uh, I lost it,"" to which the first officer replied, ""see its right there."" The captain then stated, ""I still dont see it...just vector me. I dont know."" At 23:43:59, the controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330º at 21 knots. At 23:44:19, the captain stated, ""see were losing it. I dont think we can maintain visual."" At 23:44:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220º for radar vectors for the ILS approach to runway 04R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. At 23:45:47, the first officer told the controller ""were getting pretty close to this storm. well keep it tight if we have to."" The controller indicated to the flight crew that, ""when you join the final, youre going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if thats gonna be okay for ya."" The captain stated, ""thats great,"" and the first officer told the controller, ""thats great with us."" At 23:46:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the outer marker. At 23:46:52, the captain stated, ""aw, were goin right into this."" At the same time, the controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the ATIS information in effect at the time was no longer current, the visibility was less than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR) for runway 04R was 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged this information.    Final approach  At 23:47:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the wind was 350º at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer then read back the wind information as 030º at 45 knots. At 23:47:22, the captain stated, ""three thousand RVR. We cant land on that."" Four seconds later, the first officer indicated that the RVR for runway 04R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, ""okay, fine."" At 23:47:44, the captain stated, ""landing gear down."" About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, ""and lights please."" At 23:47:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, reporting that the centerfield wind was 350º at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north boundary wind was 310º at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. At 23:48:10, the captain stated, ""add twenty [knots],"" to which the first officer replied, ""right."" At 23:48:12, the controller reported that the runway 04R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 23:48:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach; 6 seconds later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340º at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300º at 26 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. At 23:48:41, the first officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions from flight 1420. At 23:49:02, the first officer asked the captain, ""want forty flaps?"" The captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the first officer stated, ""forty now."" At 23:49:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the wind was 330º at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, ""this is a can of worms."" The first officer stated, ""theres the runway off to your right, got it?"" at 23:49:24. The captain replied, ""no,"" to which the first officer stated, ""I got the runway in sight. Youre right on course. Stay where youre at."" The captain then stated, ""I got it. I got it."" At 23:49:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330º at 25 knots. At 23:49:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320º at 23 knots. From about 400 feet above field level (afl) the airplane drifted to the right. At 23:50:00, the first officer said, ""were way off."" The localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at that point. About 1 second later, the captain stated, ""I cant see it."" About 3 seconds afterward, the first officer asked, ""got it?"" to which the captain replied, ""yeah I got it."" At 23:50:13 and :14, the GPWS radio altitude callout ""sink rate"" sounded.    Landing  The airplane touched down on the runway about 23:50:20. About 23:50:22, the first officer stated ""were down;"" about 2 seconds later, he stated, ""were sliding."" Over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and right engines engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively. The thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor stowed). The flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown. About the time that the brakes were applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. At 23:50:32, the CVR recorded an unidentified voice in the cockpit stating ""on the brakes."" The left engine reached a maximum setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left brake pedal was relaxed at 23:50:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. At 23:50:36, a full aileron deflection was given. At 23:50:40, the left thrust reverser was moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the flight. After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward from the left edge of the instrument landing system localizer array, located 411 feet beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to discontinue the approach when severe thunderstorms and their associated hazards to flight operations had moved into the airport area and the flight crew's failure to ensure that the spoilers had extended after touchdown. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's (1) impaired performance resulting from fatigue and the situational stress associated with the intent to land under the circumstances, (2) continuation of the approach to a landing when the company's maximum crosswind component was exceeded, and (3) use of reverse thrust greater than 1.3 engine pressure ratio after landing.

	   Hong Kong",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Songshan Airport (TSA/RCSS),Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG/VHHH),"The aircraft was making an ILS approach to runway 31 during a heavy rainstorm. The captain was busy seeking visual contact with the ground and didn't notice the descend through the minimum altitude of 415 feet. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft, made an abrupt heading change (while already 80 feet below the glide slope) and was possibly caught by downdraft, causing the aircraft to enter a high rate of descent and a crash into the sea short of the runway.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""a) The pilots did not adhere to the Thai Airways procedure for a 'captain monitored' approach in bad visibility; b) The captain did not monitor the approach adequately; c) The co-pilot mishandled the aircraft after descending below minimum altitude; downdrafts may be contributed to the height loss which resulted from this mishandling."""

During the descent and approach to Kiev, the flight crew likely became incapacitated by carbon monoxide. Several check list items were not accomplished, among others setting the barometric altimeter to airfield pressure. The flight crew commenced the final approach prematurely and the aircraft impacted terrain on a tank training range near Gorenychi at a speed of 420 km/h and a vertical speed of 3 m/s.  Probable cause: The likely cause of the disaster may be the loss of crew performance due to exposure to carbon monoxide and other toxic components. This led to the failure to perform a number of operations during the descent, including the failure to establish the barometric pressure of the aerodrome, which was also facilitated by the overlap in the communication of the controller with the crew. The result was a premature descent in the aircraft and its collision with the ground."

The aircraft operated a scheduled flight from Genève-Cointrin Airport (GVA), Switzerland to Skopje Airport (SKP), Macedonia. Because of heavy snowfall at Skopje, the flight diverted to Ohrid.  The first approach to runway 02 at Ohrid was abandoned and a missed approach procedure was executed. The airplane was manoeuvring for another approach when it flew into the side of Mount Trojani at an elevation of 4900 feet, which is about 2600 feet above airfield elevation. The GPWS sounded during seven seconds prior to the impact. At the time of the accident the VOR beacon at Ohrid was not working. Macedonian investigators said this was a factor in the accident. The crew did not follow the airport traffic pattern and continued with the approach even though they were unaware of their exact position. Russian prosecutors however claimed that there was a misunderstanding because air traffic controller spoke Macedonian while the crew used Russian and English in their transmissions."

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crews continuation of an unstabilized approach and their failure to monitor the aircrafts altitude during the approach, which led to an inadvertent descent below the minimum approach altitude and subsequently into terrain. Contributing to the accident were  (1) the flight crews failure to properly configure and verify the flight management computer for the profile approach;  (2) the captains failure to communicate his intentions to the first officer once it became apparent the vertical profile was not captured;  (3) the flight crews expectation that they would break out of the clouds at 1,000 feet above ground level due to incomplete weather information;  (4) the first officers failure to make the required minimums callouts;  (5) the captains performance deficiencies likely due to factors including, but not limited to, fatigue, distraction, or confusion, consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during training; and  (6) the first officers fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective off-duty time management and circadian factor."

On board were 49 passengers and eleven crew members. The first officer was pilot flying, the captain was pilot monitoring. Following de-icing, the Airbus A310 taxied to runway 08R for departure. The flight was cleared via the Strejnic 'STJ' VOR/DME beacon and an initial climb to flight level 260. Takeoff was initiated at 09:04 hours local time.  When airborne, the captain announced positive climb and co-pilot requested to retract the landing gear. At 09:07:20 the captain called the Otopeni Approach controller and received a clearance to turn left and proceed direct to STJ. The co-pilot asked the captain to select direct STJ on FMS. The captain confirmed a direct STJ selection and requested the co-pilot to move the control wheel slightly. At an altitude of 1700 feet and speed a 187 knots, with flaps 15/slats 15 and pitch angle of 17.6 degrees, the aircraft was turning left, with a bank angle of 12 degrees, flying towards STJ. At 09:07:36, when the aircraft crossed 2000 feet at 188 knots, an engine thrust asymmetry started developing with continuous decrease of the left engine thrust, approximately 1 degree TRA (throttle resolver angle)/second. At 09:07:53, when the aircraft was crossing 3300 feet altitude at 195 kts turning with a decreasing bank angle of 20 degrees, the first officer called ""250 in sight"" and asked the captain to retract the flaps. This was carried out. At that moment, the engine thrust asymmetry reached 14.5 TRA degrees and 0.19 for EPRs. The first officer then requested slats retraction, but this action which was not carried out by the captain. At this moment the aircraft was passing through 013 degrees magnetic heading, at 3800 feet altitude and a decreasing speed of 185 kts. The aircraft pitch angle was 16,5 degrees, decreasing, and the left bank angle was 18 degrees, also decreasing. At that time the thrust asymmetry reached was 28 TRA degrees and 0.27 for EPRs. At 09:08:02, the first officer asked the captain: ""Are you all right?"" The aircraft was passing through 330 degrees magnetic heading, 4200 ft altitude, a decreasing speed of 181 kts, and an increasing 17 degrees left bank angle. At 09:08:08, a noise like an uttering of pain or a metallic noise was heard. The aircraft was crossing 4460 ft altitude, 179 kts speed and an increasing bank angle of 22 degrees. At that time the engines thrust asymmetry reached 0.36 for EPRs. The bank angle continued to increase to 28 degrees and the engine thrust asymmetry reached 0.41 for EPRs. At 09:08:15, the first officer, with a stressed and agitated voice, requested engagement of autopilot no. 1. The aircraft was crossing 4620-ft altitude, continuing its turn at an increasing bank angle of 43 degrees and a steadily decreasing pitch angle of 3.5 degrees. One of the pilots attempted to engage autopilot no. 1 The aircraft started a descent with 45 degrees bank angle and the engine thrust asymmetry had reached the maximum value of 0.42 for EPRs, followed by a continuous thrust reduction of engine no. 2. One second later, there was recorded autopilot disengagement followed by the aural warning a level 3 ""cavalry charge"" lasting several moments. From that moment on, the aircraft started diving, the speed increased and the aircraft performed a complete rotation around its roll axis. At 09:08.28, first officer cried out ""THAT ONE HAS FAILED!"" without any other comments. The aircraft was descending through 3600 ft at 258 kts speed and an increasing nose down pitch angle at 61.5 degrees. The aircraft continued until it impacted the ground at a nose down attitude of approximately 50 degrees pitch angle with both engines at idle power. The airplane was destroyed and all 60 occupants were sustained fatal injuries.  The investigation commission consider the following causal factors: - Thrust assymetry; - Possible pilot incapacitation (the Captain); - Insuficient corrective action from the Copilot in order to cover the consequences of the first factors.  The French Ministry of Transport commented on the Romanian investigation report, stating that the pilot flying's actions that led to the loss of control could have been caused by the fact that the artificial horizon between Eastern and Western built aircraft is inverted in roll and that the first officer spent the majority of his carreer on Eastern-built aircraft."

	   France",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Lyon Satolas Airfield (LYS/LFLL),Strasbourg-Entzheim Airport (SXB/LFST),"Air Inter Flight 5148, an Airbus A320, took off from Lyon (LYS) at 18:20 on a domestic service to Strasbourg-Entzheim Airport (SXB). Following an uneventful flight the crew prepared for a descent and approach to Strasbourg. At first the crew asked for an ILS approach to runway 26 followed by a visual circuit to land on runway 05. This was not possible because of departing traffic from runway 26. The Strasbourg controllers then gave flight 148 radar guidance to ANDLO at 11DME from the Strasbourg VORTAC. Altitude over ANDLO was 5000 feet. After ANDLO the VOR/DME approach profile calls for a 5.5% slope (3.3deg angle of descent) to the Strasbourg VORTAC. While trying to program the angle of descent, ""-3.3"", into the Flight Control Unit (FCU) the crew did not notice that it was in HDG/V/S (heading/vertical speed) mode. In vertical speed mode ""-3.3"" means a descent rate of 3300 feet/min. In TRK/FPA (track/flight path angle) mode this would have meant a (correct) -3.3deg descent angle. A -3.3deg descent angle corresponds with an 800 feet/min rate of descent. The Vosges mountains near Strasbourg were in clouds above 2000 feet, with tops of the layer reaching about 6400 feet when flight 148 started descending from ANDLO. At about 3nm from ANDLO the aircraft struck trees and impacted a 2710 feet high ridge at the 2620 feet level near Mt. Saint-Odile. Because the aircraft was not GPWS-equipped, the crew were not warned.  THE MECHANISM OF THE ACCIDENT: After analysing the accident mechanisms, the commission reach the following conclusions: 1 - The crew was late in modifying its approach strategy due to ambiguities in communication with air traffic control. They then let the controller guide them and relaxed their attention, particularly concerning their aircraft position awareness, and did not sufficiently anticipated preparing the aircraft configuration for landing. 2 - In this situation, and because the controller's radar guidance did not place the aircraft in a position which allowed the pilot flying to align it before ANDLO, the crew was faced with a sudden workload peak in making necessary lateral corrections, preparing the aircraft configuration and initiating the descent. 3 - The key event in the accident sequence was the start of aircraft descent at the distance required by the procedure but at an abnormally high vertical speed (3300 feet/min) instead of approx. 800 feet/min, and the crew failure to correct this abnormally high rate of descent. 4 - The investigation did not determined, with certainty, the reason for this excessively high rate of descent . Of all the possible explanations it examined, the commission selected the following as seen most worthy of wider investigation and further preventative actions: 4.1 - The rather probably assumptions of confusions in vertical modes (due either to the crew forgetting to change the trajectory reference or to incorrect execution of the change action) or of incorrect selection of the required value (for example, numerical value stipulated during briefing selected unintentionally) . 4.2 - The highly unlikely possibility of a FCU failure (failure of the mode selection button or corruption of the target value the pilot selected on the FCU ahead of its use by the auto-pilot computer). 5 - Regardless of which of these possibilities short-listed by the commission is considered, the accident was made possible by the crew's lack of noticing that the resulting vertical trajectory was incorrect, this being indicated, in particular, by a vertical speed approximately four times higher than the correct value, an abnormal nose-down attitude and an increase in speed along the trajectory . 6 - The commission attributes this lack of perception by the crew to the following factors, mentioned in an order which in no way indicates priority: 6.1 - Below-average crew performance characterised by a significant lack of cross-checks and checks on the outputs of actions delegated to automated systems. This lack is particularly obvious by the failure to make a number of the announcements required by the operating manual and a lack of the height/range check called for as part of a VOR DME approach. 6.2 - An ambiance in which there was only minimum communication between crew members; 6.3 - The ergonomics of the vertical trajectory monitoring parameters display, adequate for normal situations but providing insufficient warning to a crew trapped in an erroneous mental representation; 6.4 - A late change to the approach strategy caused by ambiguity in crew-ATC communication ; 6.5 - A relaxation of the crew's attention during radar guidance followed by an instantaneous peak workload which led them to concentrate on the horizontal position and the preparation of the aircraft configuration, delegating the vertical control entirely to the aircraft automatic systems; 6.6 - During the approach alignment phase, the focusing of both crew members attention on the horizontal navigation and their lack of monitoring of the auto-pilot controlled vertical trajectory ; 6.7 - The absence of a GPWS and an appropriate doctrine for its use, which deprived the crew of a last chance of being warned of the gravity of the situation. 7 - Moreover, notwithstanding the possibility of a FCU failure, the commission considers that the ergonomic design of the auto-pilot vertical modes controls could have contributed to the creation of the accident situation . It believes the design tends to increase the probability of certain e"

The airplane climbed to FL390 and was vectored around a storm area. Just before the Waverly controller wanted to hand off Flight 11 Kansas City Center, in the vicinity of Centerville, IA, an explosive decompression occurred. The flight crew initiate the required emergency descent procedures and donned their smoke masks due to the dense fog which formed in the cabin immediately after the decompression. At separation of the tail, the remaining aircraft structure pitched nose down violently, causing the engines to tear off, after which it fell in uncontrolled gyrations. The fuselage of the Boeing 707, minus the aft 38 feet, and with part of the left and most of the right wing intact, struck the ground, headed westerly down a 10-degree slope of an alfalfa field. Investigation by the FBI revealed that Thomas G. Doty had purchased a life insurance policy for $150,000, the maximum available; his death would also bring in another $150,000 in additional insurance (some purchased at the airport) and death benefits. Doty had recently been arrested for armed robbery and was to soon face a preliminary hearing in the matter. Investigators determined that Doty had purchased dynamite shortly before the crash, and were able to deduce that a bomb had been placed in the used towel bin of the right rear lavatory.

Ten crew and 122 passengers were on the flight when, after a considerable delay to await the arrival of passengers, it was cleared to take off from runway 08 at Orly Airport at 11:32 UTC. It aligned itself for takeoff and waited 6 seconds, which permitted the setting and checking of takeoff parameters on the four engines. Full thrust was applied, and the aircraft accelerated normally. From testimony and flight recorder data, the takeoff was reconstructed as follows. Between 20 to 40 seconds after the start of the roll, the rate of acceleration was steady at 1.80 m/s2. The aircraft rolled along the runway centre line without showing any tendency to veer to either side. V1, determined as 147 kt IAS, was attained after a ground roll of 1500 m. This was followed by VR, 158 kt IAS. Forty-eight seconds after the beginning of the takeoff run and approximately when passing the 1800 m mark, the aircraft reached the rotation speed (VR), and the pilot-in-command initiated the takeoff manoeuvre by pulling backwards on the control column. According to witnesses, the aircraft made an incomplete rotational movement about 2100 m from the threshold. It remained for 4 to 6 seconds with its nose slightly raised. Then the nose dropped when the brakes were applied. Thick smoke streamed from the wheels. The aircraft was 2600 m from its starting point and had reached a maximum speed of 179 kt IAS. It braked for the last 680 m of the runway with an average deceleration of 1.2 to 1.3 m/s After 250 m of braking the aircraft veered slightly to the left, and 50deg of flap were selected. Then after another 250 m the aircraft listed heavily to starboard. Its path then curved right, which suggests a possible attempt to ground loop. However, the aircraft's speed precluded the success of this manoeuvre, and it left the runway while still on the centre line. It rolled for a while on the grass extension of the runway but, because of the unevenness of the terrain and the high speed of the aircraft (160 kt), the port gear broke off 110 m from the end of the runway and was wrenched away. The aircraft pivoted left, and engines No. 1 and 2 scraped the ground. Fire broke out in the port wing at the level of the landing gear. About 300 m beyond the end of the runway the aircraft crossed the encircling road. The starboard gear collapsed, and No. 2 engine broke loose. It then struck the approach lights, which represented a considerable obstacle. It started to disintegrate when reaching the hollow at the end of the runway extension, which descends at a steep angle towards the Seine. The front part of the fuselage struck a house and garage. The nose of the aircraft broke away, and the rest of the fuselage came to a stop 100 m further on. The site of the accident was 550 m beyond the end of runway 08 on its extended centre line, at an elevation of 89 m.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was due to the concurrence of: 1) a considerable out-of-trim condition producing major loads on the control column at VR and VLOF which may have seemed prohibitive to the pilot-in-command; and 2) a failure of the trim servo motor control system which prevented the pilot-in-command from rectifying  the faulty setting of the stabilizer and, consequently, from reducing the reaction at the control column. These factors led the pilot-in-command to discontinue take-off, but it was too late to stop the aircraft on the runway or slow it down sufficiently before the end of the runway."""

The aircraft diverted to Rome for refueling. The hijackers demanded the release of eleven Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorists detained in a German prison, and US$15 million. The airplane, named ""Landshut"", continued its journey, landing in Larnaca, Bahrain and Dubai, following a series of denied landing clearances in other airports across the Arabian Peninsula.  Flight 181 then flew to Salalah, in Oman, where it was denied landing, and changed course to Aden. As the main runway was blocked by vehicles and the plane was running low on fuel, the captain had no choice but to land on a sand strip nearby. In order to verify the condition of the landing gear following the rough landing, he was allowed to temporarily leave the plane. However, the captain did not immediately return to the plane after the inspection, even after numerous attempts to recall him and a threat to blow up the plane on the ground. The reasons for this prolonged absence are unclear; however, some reports indicate that the captain asked the Yemeni authorities to inhibit the continuation of the flight and to respond to the terrorists' demands. The captain returned to the airplane but he was shot in the head by one of the hijackers. The plane was refuelled and took off at 02:00 on the 17th, piloted by the co-pilot, with course towards the Somali capital of Mogadishu. On October 17, at around 03:30 UTC, the 737 landed in Mogadishu were the captain's body was thrown on the tarmac, and an ultimatum was set for the RAF prisoners to be released by 14:30 UTC. After pouring the duty free spirits over the hostages in preparation for destroying the plane, the hijackers were told that prisoners were to be released and that the transfer to Mogadishu required several more hours, they extended the deadline to the next morning, 00:30 UTC. By order of German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a team of GSG 9 commandos assembled in Dubai. The team flew to Mogadishu in a white-painted Luftwaffe Boeing 707. After a Somali Ranger battalion had secured the airfield, the team stormed the airliner at 23:05 UTC (October 18 locally).

The PIC did not manage the task sharing; crew resource management practices were not followed. 2) The crew focused their attention on trouble shooting the Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure and neither pilot was flying the aircraft. 3) After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft exceeded 30 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. 4) The AdamAir syllabus of pilot training did not cover complete or partial IRS failure. 5) The pilots had not received training in aircraft upset recovery, including spatial disorientation.  OTHER CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) At the time of the accident, AdamAir had not resolved the airworthiness problems with the IRS that had been reoccurring on their Boeing 737 fleet for more than 3 months. 2) The AdamAir maintenance engineering supervision and oversight was not effective and did not ensure that repetitive defects were rectified."

	   Turkey",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Izmir-Adnan Menderes Airport (ADB/LTBJ),Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen International Airport (SAW/LTFJ),"Pegasus Airlines flight 2193, a Boeing 737-800, suffered a runway excursion after landing on runway 06 at Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Turkey. There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured. The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 17:22 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 18:17 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind. Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure. At 18:19 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation. Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road.  Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope.  In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English. After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment."

The Boeing continued to descend however and contacted the ground 1120 m past the end of runway 24 and struck an elevated road 114 m further on. The aircraft broke up and caught fire before coming to rest 454 m past the initial point of impact.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by the crew initiating a take-off with the leading edge flaps retracted  because the pneumatic system which operates them had not been switched on. This resulted in the aircraft becoming airborne in a partially stalled condition which the pilots did not identify in the short time available to them for recovery.

	   Taiwan",Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Chiang Kai Shek International Airport (TPE/RCTP),"Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX)","Singapore Airlines Flight 006 departed Singapore for a flight to Los Angeles via Taipei. Scheduled departure time at Taipei was 22:55. The flight left gate B-5 and taxied to taxiway NP, which ran parallel to runway 05L and 05R. The crew had been cleared for a runway 05L departure because runway 05R was closed because of construction work. CAA Taiwan had issued a NOTAM on Aug 31, 2000 indicating that part of runway 05R between Taxiway N4 and N5 was closed for construction between Sept. 13 to Nov. 22, 2000. Runway 05R was to have been converted and re-designated as Taxiway NC effective Nov. 1, 2000. After reaching the end of taxiway NP, SQ006 turned right into Taxiway N1 and immediately made a 180-degree turn to runway 05R. After approximately 6 second hold, SQ006 started its takeoff roll at 23:15:45. Weather conditions were very poor because of typhoon 'Xiang Sane' in the area. METAR at 23:20 included Wind 020 degrees at 36 knots gusting 56 knots, visibility - 600 meters, and heavy rainfall. On takeoff, 3.5 seconds after V1, the aircraft hit concrete barriers, excavators and other equipment on the runway. The plane crashed back onto the runway, breaking up and bursting into flames while sliding down the runway and crashing into other objects related to work being done on runway 05R. The aircraft wreckage was distributed along runway 05R beginning at about 4,080 feet from the runway threshold. The airplane broke into two main sections at about fuselage station 1560 and came to rest about 6,480 feet from the runway threshold.  FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES:  - At the time of the accident, heavy rain and strong winds from typhoon ""Xangsane"" prevailed. At 2312:02 Taipei local time, the flight crewmembers of SQ006 received Runway Visual Range (RVR) 450 meters on Runway 05L from Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) ""Uniform"". At 2315:22 Taipei local time, they received wind direction 020 degrees with a magnitude of 28 knots, gusting to 50 knots, together with the takeoff clearance issued by the local controller.  - On August 31, 2000, CAA of ROC issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) A0606 indicating that a portion of the Runway 05R between Taxiway N4 and N5 was closed due to work in progress from September 13 to November 22, 2000. The flight crew of SQ006 was aware of the fact that a portion of Runway 05R was closed, and that Runway 05R was only available for taxi.   -  The aircraft did not completely pass the Runway 05R threshold marking area and continue to taxi towards Runway 05L for the scheduled takeoff. Instead, it entered Runway 05R and CM-1 commenced the takeoff roll. CM-2 and CM-3 did not question CM-1's decision to take off.  -  The flight crew did not review the taxi route in a manner sufficient to ensure they all understood that the route to Runway 05L included the need for the aircraft to pass Runway 05R, before taxiing onto Runway 05L.  -  The flight crew had CKS Airport charts available when taxing from the parking bay to the departure runway; however, when the aircraft was turning from Taxiway NP to Taxiway NI and continued turning onto Runway 05R, none of the flight crewmembers verified the taxi route. As shown on the Jeppesen ""20-9"" CKS Airport chart, the taxi route to Runway 05L required that the aircraft make a 90-degree right turn from Taxiway NP and then taxi straight ahead on Taxiway NI, rather than making a continuous 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R. Further, none of the flight crewmembers confirmed orally which runway they had entered.  -  CM-1's expectation that he was approaching the departure runway coupled with the saliency of the lights leading onto Runway 05R resulted in CM?1 allocating most of his attention to these centerline lights. He followed the green taxiway centerline lights and taxied onto Runway 05R.  -  The moderate time pressure to take off before the inbound typhoon closed in around CKS Airport, and the condition of taking off in a strong crosswind, low visibility, and slippery runway subtly influenced the flight crew's decision?making ability and the ability to maintain situational awareness.  - 	On the night of the accident, the information available to the flight crew regarding the orientation of the aircraft on the airport was:  -  CKS Airport navigation chart -  Aircraft heading references -  Runway and Taxiway signage and marking -  Taxiway NI centerline lights leading to Runway 05L -  Color of the centerline lights (green) on Runway 05R -  Runway 05R edge lights most likely not on -  Width difference between Runway 05L and Runway 05R -  Lighting configuration differences between Runway 05L and Runway 05R -  Para-Visual Display (PVD) showing aircraft not properly aligned with the Runway 05L localizer -  Primary Flight Display (PFD) information  The flight crew lost situational awareness and commenced takeoff from the wrong runway.    The Singapore Ministry of Transport (MOT) did not agree with the findings and released their own report. They conclude that the systems, procedures and facilities at the CKS Airport were seriously inadequate and that the accident could have been avoided if internationally-accepted precautionary measures had been in place at the Airport."

The aircraft taxied to runway 23 for departure. At 15:59 the flight was cleared for takeoff when ready. The aircraft made an apparently normal takeoff roll. Rotation appeared more rapidly achieved and steeper than usual and the aircrafts tail passed unusually close to the runway surface. Almost immediately, the starboard wing dropped and the aircraft began turning to starboard while still in a nose-up attitude. The aircraft lost height by sideslipping inward and the starboard wing tip then struck a grassed area close to the edge of the runway. The aircraft pivoted about its nose at a fuselage-to-ground angle of about 50 degrees. Fire broke out in the vicinity of the starboard wing root and the aircraft rapidly began to disintegrate. Following nose impact, the entire flight deck section broke loose and eventually came to rest inverted.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The incurrance of reverse thrust during simulated failure of no. 4 engine on takeoff. That condition arose when very rapid rearward movement of the power level generated an inertia force which caused the associated thrust brake lever to rise and enter the reverse idle detent. After lift-off, the minimum control speed essentially required to overcome the prevailing state of thrust imbalance was never attained and an uncontrollable roll, accompanied by some degree of yaw and sideslip in the same direction, ensued. When the condition of reverse thrust was recognised and eliminated, insufficient time and height were available to allow the aircraft to recover from its precarious attitude before it struck the ground."""

The DC-10 arrived at Málaga at 10:20 where 251 passengers embarked. The crew then taxied to the threshold of runway 14. Takeoff clearance was received at 11:58. During takeoff the copilot called out the 80 knots and 100 knots speeds. A short time before reaching V1 (162 kts), pieces of tread of a nose wheel tire started to detach. At or close to V1 a vibration was felt. The airplane continued to accelerate through VR. As the captain tried to rotate by applying up elevator, the vibration was of such magnitude that he feared that the plane might become uncontrollable after takeoff. He decided to abort the takeoff. At that point, with a maximum speed attained of 184 kts, there was 1295 m (4,250 feet) of runway left. The captain retarded the throttles and tried to select reverse thrust. The no. 3 throttle slipped from his hands, causing a power asymmetry. The airplane veered slightly to the left. The Dc-10 overshot the runway at a speed of 110 kts, colliding with an ILS building, causing engine number 3 to separate. The airplane went through a fence and crossed a highway were it damaged three vehicles. It then collided with a farming construction, causing three quarters of the right wing to break off, as well as the right horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft stopped 450 m (1,475 feet) past the end of runway 14. A fire erupted in the rear of the fuselage.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Commission determines the cause of the accident to be the fractional detachment of the retread of the right wheel of the nose gear, originating a strong vibration which could not be identified by the captain, leading hime into the belief that the aircraft would become uncontrollable in flight, and thus deciding to abandon the take-off over VR. The decision of aborting the take-off, though not in accordance with the standard operation procedure, is in this case considered reasonable, on the base of the irregular circumstances that the crew had to face, the short period of time available to take the decision, the lack of training in case of wheel failure and the absence of take-off procedures when failure other than that of the engines occurs."""

It departed Milwaukee at 13:36 and arrived in Madison at 13:55 after an uneventful flight. At Madison, N100ME was designated as flight 105 to Atlanta (ATL), with an intermediate stop in Milwaukee. Flight 105 departed Madison at 14:25 and arrived at Milwaukee, on time and without incident, at 14:41. About 14:49, the first officer of flight 105 contacted Milwaukee Tower to request an instrument flight rule (IFR) clearance to Atlanta. The clearance was received. The Atlanta forecast included a 1,000-foot ceiling, visibility 2 miles, thunderstorms and rain showers.  At 15:12, the Before Engine Start Checklist was read and accomplished in accordance with Midwest Express operating procedures. Engine start was commenced at 15:14 and the After Start Checklist was accomplished. The first officer requested clearance to taxi to runway 19R for departure. About 15:17:50, the Taxi Checklist was completed, and the engine pressure ratio (EPR) and airspeed reference bugs were set to 1.91 and 133 knots, respectively. Both indications were correct for the departure conditions applicable to flight 105. At the conclusion of the Taxi Checklist, the captain advised the first officer ""Standard briefing ..."" At 15:19:15, the first officer reported to the tower local controller, ""Milwaukee, Midex 105, ready on 19R."" Flight 105 was cleared to ""position and hold"" on runway 19R. The captain called for the Before Takeoff Checklist, which was completed in accordance with the COM. Flight 105 was cleared for takeoff at 15:20:28; the first officer acknowledged the clearance. The captain operated the flight controls, and the first officer handled radio communications and other copilot responsibilities during the takeoff. The Midwest Express DC-9 Flight Operations Manual required the use of standard noise abatement takeoff procedures during all line operations, unless precluded by safety considerations or special noise abatement procedures. At the time flight 105 departed, noise abatement procedures were in effect. Midwest Express also utilized ""reduced thrust"" takeoff procedures (at the captain's discretion) to extend engine life. The flightcrew was complying with the reduced thrust and standard noise abatement takeoff procedures. The takeoff roll and liftoff were normal, with liftoff occurring near the intersection of the midfield taxiway and runway 19R, about 4,200 feet from the start of the takeoff roll. Rotation to the takeoff attitude occurred at 140 knots. The DC-9 accelerated to 168 knots with a rate of climb of about 3,000 feet/minute, indicating a normal two-engine initial takeoff flightpath. At 15:21:26 N100ME was about 7,600 feet down the runway, reaching a height of 450 feet above the ground. At that moment there was a loud noise and a noticeable decrease in engine sound. The captain then remarked ""What the # was that?"" The first officer did not respond. At 15:21:29, the local controller transmitted, ""Midex 105, turn left heading 175."" At the time of his transmission he observed smoke and flame emanating from the right airplane engine. The captain asked the first officer, ""What do we got here, Bill?"" The first officer did not respond to the captain but advised the local controller, ""Midex 105, roger, we've got an emergency here."" Two seconds later, the captain said, ""Here""; again there was no response. Neither pilot made the call outs for ""Max Power"" or ""Ignition Override-Check Fuel System,"" which were part of the Midwest Express ""Engine Failure after V1"" emergency procedure. Meanwhile the airplane began to deviate substantially to the right and the heading changed from 194 degrees to 260 degrees in eight seconds. The vertical acceleration dropped sharply to about 0.3 G and increased to a value of 1.8 G. At that point the airplane stalled. This accelerated stall occurred at a KIAS of about 156 kts.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's improper use of flight controls in response to the catastrophic failure of the right engine during a critical phase of flight, which led to an accelerated stall and loss of control of the airplane. Contributing to the loss of control was a lack of crew coordination in response to the emergency. The right engine failed from the rupture of the 9th to 10th stage removable sleeve spacer in the high pressure compressor because of the spacer's vulnerability to cracks."""

About 18:53, flight 255 departed Saginaw and about 19:42 arrived at its gate at Detroit.  About 20:32, flight 255 departed the gate with 149 passengers and 6 crewmembers on board. During the pushback, the flightcrew accomplished the BEFORE (engine) START portion of the airplane checklist, and, at 20:33, they began starting the engines. The flight was then cleared to ""taxi via the ramp, hold short of (taxiway) delta and expect runway three center [3C] (for takeoff)..."" The ground controller amended the clearance, stating that the flight had to exit the ramp at taxiway Charlie. The crew was requested to change radio frequencies. The first officer repeated the taxi clearance, but he did not repeat the new radio frequency nor did he tune the radio to the new frequency.  At 20:37, the captain asked the first officer if they could use runway 3C for takeoff as they had initially expected 21L or 21R. After consulting the Runway Takeoff Weight Chart Manual, the first officer told the captain runway 3C could be used for takeoff. During the taxi out, the captain missed the turnoff at taxiway C. When the first officer contacted ground control, the ground controller redirected them to taxi to runway 3C and again requested that they change radio frequencies. The first officer repeated the new frequency, changed over, and contacted the east ground controller. The east ground controller gave the flight a new taxi route to runway 3C, told them that windshear alerts were in effect, and that the altimeter setting was 29.85 inHg. The flightcrew acknowledged receipt of the information. At 20:42, the local controller cleared flight 255 to taxi into position on runway 3C and to hold. He told the flight there would be a 3-minute delay in order to get the required ""in-trail separation behind traffic just departing."" At 20:44:04, flight 255 was cleared for takeoff. Engine power began increasing at 20:44:21. The flightcrew could not engage the autothrottle system at first, but, at 20:44:38, they did engage the system, and the first officer called 100 knots at 20:44:45. At 20:44:57, the first officer called ""Rotate."" Eight seconds later, the stall warning stick shaker activated, accompanied by voice warnings of the supplemental stall recognition system (SSRS). The takeoff warning system indicating that the airplane was not configured properly for takeoff, did not sound at any time prior or during takeoff. After flight 255 became airborne it began rolling to the left and right before the left wing hit a light pole in a rental car lot.  After impacting the light pole, flight 255 continued to roll to the left, continued across the car lot, struck a light pole in a second rental car lot, and struck the side wall of the roof of the auto rental facility in the second rental car lot. The airplane continued rolling to the left when it impacted the ground on a road outside the airport boundary. The airplane continued to slide along the road, struck a railroad embankment, and disintegrated as it slid along the ground. Fires erupted in airplane components scattered along the wreckage path. Three occupied vehicles on the road and numerous vacant vehicles in the auto rental parking lot along the airplane's path were destroyed by impact forces and or fire. One passenger, a 4-year-old child was injured seriously.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to use the taxi checklist to ensure that the flaps and slats were extended for take-off. Contributing the accident was the absence of electrical power to the airplane take-off warning system which thus did not warn the flight crew that the airplane was not configured properly for take-off. The reason for the absence of electrical power could not be determined."""

The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of 11.600 m and maintained an airspeed of 400 km/h, which was close to stall speed under the given conditions. During cruise flight vibrations started because of the low airspeed. The crew assumed that the vibrations were caused by engine surges. They reduced power to flight idle, causing the airspeed to drop to 290 km/h. Trying to maintain altitude, the angle of attack increased until the airplane eventually stalled. The Tu-154 went into a flat spin and crashed.  Cause (translated from Russian): The cause of the accident was the aircraft entering a flat spin during the flight at a jet stream altitude with a high aircraft weight, influenced by high non-standard outside air temperature, low margin of angle of attack, and engine thrust. In these flight conditions and rapidly developing catastrophic situation, the crew deviated from the requirements of the flight manual, lost speed, and failed to maintain control of the aircraft."

The flight was instructed to maintain 11500 feet and report at 16 DME (16 miles from the VOR/DME beacon, which is located 0,6 nm short of the runway). The Kathmandu approach is very difficult, since the airport is located in an oval-shaped valley surrounded by mountains as high as 9665 feet. Runway elevation is 4313 feet amsl.

The Airbus impacted a steep cloud-covered hillside at approx. 7300 feet amsl at 9,16 DME.  Cause: ""The balance of evidence suggests that the primary cause of the accident was that one or both pilots consistently failed to follow the approach procedure and inadvertently adopted a profile which, at each DME fix, was one altitude step ahead and below the correct procedure. Why and how that happened could not be determined with certainty because there was no record of the crew's conversation on the flight deck. Contributory causal factors were thought to be the inevitable complexity of the approach and the associated approach chart."""

Due to the harmattan, a dusty seasonal wind from the deserts of north Africa, the flight continued directly to Abidjan. The aircraft, named ""Harambee Star"", landed there at 15:15 local time.  The Airbus was prepared for the return flight, KQ431, to Lagos and Nairobi that evening. Shortly after 21:00 the crew received clearance to taxy to runway 21 for departure. The trim was set at 0.9 nose up, slats and flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane began to taxi at 21:07, the tower controller informed the crew of the latest wind, cleared them to take off and asked the crew the call back when they reached flight level 40. At 21:08:18, the captain, who was pilot non flying, applied takeoff power and announced ""thrust, SRS, and runway"" then, nine seconds later ""100 knots"". Flight 431 took off and at 21:08:57, the copilot announced ""Positive rate of climb, gear up"". Less than two seconds later, at a height of around 300 feet, the stall warning sounded. The gear was not retracted. The copilot, who was the pilot flying, pushed forward on the control column in reaction to the stall warnings. At 21:09:07, the copilot asked, ""Whats the problem?"" The aircraft descended and less than a second before passing through 100 feet in descent, the copilot ordered the aural stall warning alarm to be disconnected. The GPWS sounded briefly, followed by the CRC (Continuous Repetitive Chime), which corresponds to a master warning of over-speed with flaps extended, immediately followed by an order from the captain ""Go up!"". The airplanes speed at this point was at least 210 knots, the maximum speed limit for a configuration with slats/flaps at 15°/15°. At 21:09:24 the airplane contacted the sea and broke up. The wreckage came to rest on the sandy seabed at a depth of 40-50 metres. Just ten of the 179 occupants survived the accident.  CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT:  ""The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 on 30 January 2000 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the pilot flying applying one part of the procedure, by pushing forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. In fact, the FCOM used by the airline states that whenever a stall warning is encountered at low altitude (stick shaker activation), it should be considered as an immediate threat to the maintenance of a safe flight path. It specifies that at the first sign of an imminent stall or at the time of a stick shaker activation, the following actions must be undertaken simultaneously: thrust levers in TOGA position, reduction of pitch attitude, wings level, check that speed brakes are retracted. The investigation showed that the pilot flying reduced the pitch attitude but did not apply TOGA thrust on the engines. The investigation was unable to determine if the crew performed the other two actions: leveling the wings and checking that the speed brakes were retracted. The following elements contributed to the accident: - the pilot flyings action on the control column put the airplane into a descent without the crew realizing it, despite the radio altimeter callouts; - the GPWS warnings that could have alerted the crew to an imminent contact with the sea were masked by the priority stall and overspeed warnings, in accordance with the rules on the prioritization of warnings; - the conditions for a takeoff performed towards the sea and at night provided no external visual references that would have allowed the crew to be aware of the direct proximity of the sea."""

	   Brazil",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,"Porto Alegre-Salgado Filho International Airport, RS (POA/SBPA)","São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, SP (CGH/SBSP)","An Airbus A320-233 operated by TAM Linhas Aéreas of Brazil was destroyed when it suffered a runway excursion after landing at São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Brazil.  TAM Flight 3054 was a regular passenger flight from Porto Alegre to São Paulo-Congonhas. The aircraft departed Porto Alegre at 17:19 with 181 passengers and 6 crew members on board. The aircraft was operating with the number 2 engine reverser de-activated, in accordance with the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). The weather prevailing along the route and at the destination was adverse, and the crew had to make a few deviations. Up to the moment of the landing, the flight occurred within the expected routine. According to information provided to the Tower controller by crews that had landed earlier, the active runway at Congonhas (35L) was wet and slippery. Runway 35L is a 6365 x 147 feet (1940 x 45 meters) asphalt runway with a Landing Distance Available of 1880 m. In the beginning of 2007, the runways at Congonhas were subjected to a restoration to correct surface irregularities and correct problems of gradient, so as to prevent water accumulation. With the new pavement, the coefficient of friction of the runway surface was improved. However, since more time was be needed until the tarmac could be ready to receive the grooving, the airport administration decided to put the main runway in operation even without the grooves on 29 June 2007.  The flight touched down at 18:54 local time at a speed of 142 knots. Airbus had introduced a simplified procedure for landing with a deactivated thrust reverser in which crews had to select reversers for both engines after landing. Computer logic would which reverser was inoperative and thus block the increase in power. This simplified procedure however added an additional 55 meters in the calculations of the runway length required for landing if the runway was contaminated. However, the flight crew failed to use this procedure and left the thrust lever of engine no.2 positioned at ""CL"". This caused the autothrust to try to maintain the speed previously selected. Another consequence was the nondeflection of the ground spoilers, since, in accordance with their logic of operation, it is necessary that both thrust levers be at the ""IDLE"" position, or one of them be at ""IDLE"" and the other at ""REV"" (reverse), for the ground spoilers to be deflected. The non-deflection of the ground spoilers significantly degraded the aircraft braking capability, increasing the distance necessary for a full stop of the airplane by about 50%. Additionally the autobrake function, although armed, was not activated, because the opening of the ground spoilers is a prerequisite for such activation. When the nose gear touched the runway, about 2.5 seconds after the left main gear, the number 1 engine thrust lever was moved to the ""REV"" position. With this action, the autothrust function of the aircraft was disconnected and the thrust lock function was activated, with the purpose of preventing the acceleration to reach the climb power level. As a result, this function froze the number 2 engine power in the value it was at that moment (EPR2 = 1.18). The thrust lock function is disabled by the movement of the thrust lever, but since this movement did not occur, the number 2 engine remained with that power until the collision. About six seconds after the main gear touched the runway, there was the first activation of the brakes by means of the pedals, which reached the maximum deflection five seconds later. The FDR also recorded the use of the rudder and the differential braking by the pedals as the aircraft veered to the left. Since the runway is at a higher elevation than the surrounding street and residential area, the A320 crossed over the Washington Luís Avenue, and collided with a concrete TAM Express building and a fuel service station at a ground speed of 96 knots.  All the persons onboard suffered fatal injuries. The accident also caused 12 fatalities on the ground among the people that were in the TAM Express building. The accident caused severe damage to the convenience shop area of the service station and to some vehicles that were parked there. The TAM Express building sustained structural damages that determined its demolition.  1. Human factors 1.1 Medical aspect a. Pain - Undetermined At a certain moment, during the approach, the PIC reported having a mild headache. Although it was not possible to verify which type of headache it was, or even to evaluate its intensity, it is possible that this trouble may have influenced his cognitive and psychomotor capabilities during the final moments of the flight, when the unpredictability of the situation demanded a higher effectiveness of performance. This factor was considered undetermined due to the impossibility of confirming its contribution in factual terms.  1.2 Operational aspect a. Training - A contributor The theoretical qualification of their pilots was founded on the exclusive use of computer interactive courses (CBT), which allowed a massive training, but did not ensure the quality of the training received. In addition, the formation of the SIC was restricted to the Right Seat Certification, something that proved insufficient for him to deal with the critical situation experienced after the landing. Lastly, there was a perception among the crews interviewed that the training through the years and on account of the high demand resulting from the companys growth was being abbreviated. b. Application of the commands - Undetermined One of the hypotheses considered in this investigation was that the pilot may have attempted to perform a procedure no longer in force at the time of the accident for the landing with a pinned reverser. This procedure consisted in the receding of both levers to the IDLE position during the flare at about a 10-foot altitude, and, after touching down, in activating the only reverser available, maintaining the thrust lever of the other engine in the IDLE position. This procedure, though being more efficient from a braking perspective, could induce the crew to making mistakes, as there were several reports of occurrences in which there was a wrong setting of the levers, motivating the manufacturer to establish a new procedure, months before the accident. Thus, there is a high probability that the PIC inadvertently left one of the thrust levers in the CL position, placing the other one first in IDLE and later in the REV position. This factor was considered undetermined due to the impossibility of confirming its contribution in factual terms. c. Cockpit coordination - A contributor Independently of the hypothesis considered, the monitoring of the flight at the landing was not appropriate, since the crew did not have perception of what was happening in the moments that preceded the impact. This loss of situational awareness hindered the adoption of an efficient and timely corrective action. d. Forgetfulness by the pilot - Undetermined It is possible that the pilot has inadvertently left one of the levers at the CL position, while trying to perform a procedure no longer in force for the operation with a pinned reverser. This factor was considered undetermined due to the impossibility of confirming its contribution in factual terms. e. Flight indiscipline - Undetermined The procedure prescribed for the operation with a pinned reverser had been modified by the manufacturer and, according to the FDR recordings, the procedure in force was known to the crew and executed by them on the leg that preceded the accident. However, as this procedure imposed an increase of up to 55 meters in the calculations of runway distance required for landing, it is possible that the PIC deliberately tried to perform adoption of a procedure no longer in force would characterize flight indiscipline. This factor was considered undetermined due to the impossibility of confirming its contribution in factual terms. f. Influence from the environment - Undetermined The operating conditions of the Congonhas runway, may have affected the crews performance from a psychological perspective, considering the state of anxiety that was present in the cockpit. In addition, the lack of luminosity resulting from the operation at night time, associated with the size and color of"

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident sequence originated when the aircraft ran into a pool of standing water at a speed very close to V1 causing a temporary reduction of engine thrust from water ingestion and a momentary loss of aircraft acceleration.

The flight was operated by a brand new Boeing 707, named ""Château de Lavoûte-Polignac"", which had just been delivered to Air France a month and a half before the accident. The aircraft took off from Caracas at 19:27 for an estimated one hour and eight-minute flight to Pointe-à-Pitre on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.  The aircraft climbed to a cruising altitude of FL330 and the flight crew contacted the Piarco FIR controller at approximately 19:53 hours. They reported flying at FL330 and estimating over Piarco at 20:00, over the OA reporting point at 20:09 and reaching Pointe-à-Pitre at 20:32. At approximately 20:09 the flight reported over OA and requested authorization to descend in five minutes time. Piarco cleared the flight to the Guadeloupe radio beacon at FL90 and asked it to report when leaving FL330 and when reaching FL150. At 20:14, three minutes sooner than planned, the crew reported leaving FL330. Seven minutes later they reported passing FL150. It was then cleared to contact the Guadeloupe ACC and was advised that an aircraft proceeding from Martinique to Guadeloupe was flying at FL80 and estimating Guadeloupe at 20:44 hours. About 20:24 the flight reached the cleared altitude of FL90. After several unsuccessful attempts the flight established radio contact with Pointe-à-Pitre Tower at 20:29. It was again cleared to FL90, given a QNH of 1016 mb and requested to report at FL90, or runway in sight. Following a different route than normal, the airplane passed a brightly lit town (Basse Terre) on the coast of Guadeloupe. The pilot-in-command probably erroneously believed that it was Pointe-à-Pitre and that he would reach Le Raizet Airport in approximately one minute.  At 20:29:35 the crew replied that the aircraft was at FL90 and they estimated they would be over the airport in approximately 1-1,5 minute. Less than one minute later they reported seeing the airport and were cleared for a visual approach to runway 11.

The instructor in one aircraft and a student in the other aircraft (92-7932) were going to practice several formations in training airspace located 9 km from airway J11L. While maneuvering during the formation sequence, the instructor inadvertently flew outside the training airspace. He crossed the airway J11L and then performed a 180 degree turn back towards the training area. In order to do so, the formation had to cross J11L again. The formation was flying about the same altitude as flight 58, causing a conflict.  The trainee was following the instructor and did not watch out for traffic when the 727 approached. The instructor ordered him to break away from the 727. The trainee banked to the left but the leading edge of the right wing of his F-86F struck the left horizontal stabilizer of the ANA plane. The fighter's right wing broke off, causing the plane to crash out of control, but the pilot ejected safely. The Boeing 727 sustained damage to the stabilizer and entered an uncontrolled descent. It passed the sound barrier and subsequently broke up.  Cause:  The first reason was that the instructor continued the training flight without noticing that he had left the training airspace and entered the jet route J11L. The second reason was: - It is estimated that the All Nippon Airways pilots saw the training aircraft at least 7 seconds before the collision, but the avoidance operation was not performed until just before the collision. This is probably because the ANA pilot did not anticipate the collision. - For the instructor, the trainee's instruction to avoid a collision was shortly given to the trainee immediately before he saw the ANA aircraft, and he could not avoid the trainee's collision. This is probably because the instructor was unable to see the ANA aircraft. - About two seconds before the collision, the trainee visually recognized the ANA aircraft slightly to the right of the accident aircraft, and immediately performed an avoidance operation, but was unable to avoid the collision. It is considered that this is because the trainee had little experience in this manoeuvre and was mainly devoted to maintaining the relative position with the instructor aircraft, and it was delayed in observing the ANA aircraft."

	   Canada",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,"Calgary International Airport, AB (YYC/CYYC)","Cranbrook Airport, BC (YXC/CYXC)","Pacific Western flight 314 was a scheduled service from Edmonton, AB (YEG) to Castlegar Airport, BC (YCG) with stops at Calgary, AB (YYC) and Cranbrook (YXC). The flight departed Calgary at 12:32 in the afternoon. The Boeing 737-200 climbed to FL200 which was reached at 12:38. Calgary ATC then reported to the Cranbrook Aeradio station that flight 314 was underway with an ETA of 13:05. At Cranbrook it was snowing with visibility reported as 3/4 of a mile. A radio equipped snow removal vehicle was sweeping the runway at the time. The Aeradio operator at Cranbrook alerted the driver of the vehicle about the incoming aircraft and gave him the ETA of 13:05; they both expected the flight would report by the ""Skookum Beacon"" on a straight-in approach to runway 16, thus giving the vehicle operator about seven minutes to get off the runway. At 12:46, while descending out of FL180, flight 314 contacted Cranbrook Aeradio. One minute later the crew were advised that snow removal was in progress. No further transmissions were received from the flight by Aeradio. The aircraft passed the Skookum beacon inbound on a straight-in instrument approach, and flew the ILS for runway 16 to touchdown. The aircraft touched down at 12:55 some 800 feet from the threshold and reverse thrust was selected. Suddenly the crew noticed a snow plough on the runway. A go-around was initiated immediately. However one of the thrust-reversers didn't fully re-stow because hydraulic power was automatically cut off at lift-off.  The aircraft became airborne prior to the 2000 foot mark, and flew down the runway at a height of 50 to 70 feet, flying over the snow plough. The left engine thrust reverser doors then deployed and the crew rapidly selected the flaps up from 40deg to 15deg. The airplane climbed to 300-400 feet, banked steeply to the left, lost height and side-slipped into the ground to the left of the runway. The aircraft broke up and caught fire.  CONCLUSIONS (FINDINGS): 1. The estimated time of arrival of the aircraft at Cranbrook, calculated by Calgary ATC, and used by Aeradio for advisory purposes was considerably in error and resulted in a traffic conftict between the arriving aircraft and a vehicle working on the runway. 2. The flight crew did not report by the Skookum beacon on final approach, as was the normal practice at Cranbrook, thereby allowing the incorrect ETA to remain undetected. 3. Regulatory provisions concerning mandatory pilot position reporting during instrument approaches were inadequate. 4. The interfaces between the organizations providing Air Traffic Services, Telecommunications (Aeradio) and Airports Services were not well enough developed to provide a reliable fail-safe flight information service. 5. The pilots lost control of the aircraft consequent upon the left engine thrust reverser deploying in flight when the aircraft was at low speed, and in a high drag configuration. 6. The FAA design standards under which the Boeing 737 was constructed did not adequatety provide for the possibility of an aborted landing after touchdown and thrust reverser initiation. 7. The lack of a suitable national system of incident reporting, investigation, and follow-up corrective action allowed operational problems to remain uncorrected. 8. Rescue efforts at the accident scene were hampered due to lack of a fire fighting vehicle capable of negotiating deep snow and shortage of trained rescue personnel."

	   Indonesia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Mataram-Selaparang Airport (AMI/WADA),Yogyakarta-Adisutjipto Airport (JOG/WARJ),"Flight 421 departed Mataram around 15:00 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL310. During the initial descent the crew decided to deviate from the planned route because of thunderstorms along their planned route. At 16:19 the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence and thunderstorm activity with extremely heavy precipitation and hail. The crew attempted to fly towards a gap between two storm cells. About 90 seconds after entering the thunderstorm, as the airplane descended through about FL180 at a flight idle power setting, both engines flamed out. The crew carried out three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The flight crews reported actions to restart the engines and APU however, were contrary to the procedures contained in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual. For instance, they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt instead of three minutes.  As the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, the crew observed the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear in a shallow, 1 metre deep part of the river. One stewardess did not survive the crash.  Similar occurrences (Boeing 737-300 double engine flameout while descending in heavy precipitation with engines at flight idle) happened May 24, 1988 and July 26, 1988. Following these incidents OMB 88-5 and AD 6-14-88 were issued to require minimum rpm of 45% and to restrict the use of autothrust in moderate/heavy precipitation; engine modification was provided for increased capacity of water ingestion.  Probable Cause: ""The NTSC determines that the probable causes of the accident were the combination of 1) The aircraft had entered severe hail and rain during weather avoidance which subsequently caused both engines flame out; 2) Two attempts of engine-relight failed because the aircraft was still in the precipitation beyond the engines certified capabilities; and 3) During the second attempt relight, the aircraft suffered run-out electrical power."""

	   India",Landing,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB),Kozhikode-Calicut Airport (CCJ/VOCL),"Air India Express flight 1344, a Boeing 737-800, suffered a runway excursion on landing at Kozhikode-Calicut Airport, India and broke in two. Both pilots and nineteen passengers died in the accident. The flight departed Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates at 10:15 UTC on a passenger service to Kozhikode-Calicut Airport. The aircraft arrived from the west, overflying the airport at 13:42 UTC. It then performed a teardrop approach to runway 28. This approach was discontinued and the aircraft subsequently flew a teardrop approach to runway 10. According to a DGCA official the aircraft touched down about 900 meters down the 2850 m long runway at 14:10 UTC (19:40 local time). The aircraft failed to stop on the remaining runway and overran. It went down a 34 m dropoff and broke in two.  Weather Weather at the time of the approaches and landing was poor. At 14:00 UTC scattered clouds were reported at 300 and 1200 feet with a few Cumulonimbus clouds at 2500 feet and overcast clouds at 8000 feet. The wind was from 260 degrees at 12 knots. Visibility was 2000 m in rain.  Airport and runway The airport has a single runway (10/28) which is located on a flattened hill. The Landing Distance Available (LDA) for both directions is 2850 m. The runway strip extended to 60 m beyond the threshold. After the paved surface, there is a runway end safety area (RESA), measuring 93 m x 90 m. The ICAO required RESA length is 90 m, whereas the recommended length is 240 m. Past the RESA there is a 35 m drop off.  PROBABLE CAUSE The probable cause of the accident was the non adherence to SOP by the PF, wherein, he continued an unstabilized approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, half way down the runway, in spite of Go Around call by PM which warranted a mandatory Go Around and the failure of the PM to take over controls and execute a Go Around. CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS The investigation team is of the opinion that the role of systemic failures as a contributory factor cannot be overlooked in this accident. A large number of similar accidents/incidents that have continued to take place, more so in AIXL, reinforce existing systemic failures within the aviation sector. These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that give rise to errors, mistakes and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system. Hence, the contributory factors enumerated below include both the immediate causes and the deeper or systemic causes. (i) The actions and decisions of the PIC were steered by a misplaced motivation to land back at Kozhikode to operate next day morning flight AXB 1373. The unavailability of sufficient number of Captains at Kozhikode was the result of faulty AIXL HR policy which does not take into account operational requirement while assigning permanent base to its Captains. There was only 01 Captain against 26 First Officers on the posted strength at Kozhikode.  (ii) The PIC had vast experience of landing at Kozhikode under similar weather conditions. This experience might have led to over confidence leading to complacency and a state of reduced conscious attention that would have seriously affected his actions, decision making as well as CRM.  (iii) The PIC was taking multiple un-prescribed anti-diabetic drugs that could have probably caused subtle cognitive deficits due to mild hypoglycaemia which probably contributed to errors in complex decision making as well as susceptibility to perceptual errors.  (iv) The possibility of visual illusions causing errors in distance and depth perception (like black hole approach and up-sloping runway) cannot be ruled out due to degraded visual cues of orientation due to low visibility and suboptimal performance of the PICs windshield wiper in rain.  (v) Poor CRM was a major contributory factor in this crash. As a consequence of lack of assertiveness and the steep authority gradient in the cockpit, the First Officer did not take over the controls in spite of being well aware of the grave situation. The lack of effective CRM training of AIXL resulted in poor CRM and steep cockpit gradient.  (vi) AIXL policies of upper level management have led to a lack of supervision in training, operations and safety practices, resulting in deficiencies at various levels causing repeated human error accidents in AIXL  (vii) The AIXL pilot training program lacked effectiveness and did not impart the requisite skills for performance enhancement. One of the drawbacks in training was inadequate maintenance and lack of periodic system upgrades of the simulator. Frequently recurring major snags resulted in negative training. Further, pilots were often not checked for all the mandatory flying exercises during simulator check sessions by the Examiners.  (viii) The non availability of OPT made it very difficult for the pilots to quickly calculate accurate landing data in the adverse weather conditions. The quick and accurate calculations would have helped the pilots to foresee the extremely low margin for error, enabling them to opt for other safer alternative.  (ix) The scrutiny of Tech Logs and Maintenance Record showed evidence of nonstandard practice of reporting of certain snags through verbal briefing rather than in writing. There was no entry of windshield wiper snag in the Tech log of VT-AXH. Though it could not be verified, but a verbal briefing regarding this issue is highly probable.  (x) The DATCO changed the runway in use in a hurry to accommodate the departure of AIC 425 without understanding the repercussions on recovery of AXB 1344 in tail winds on a"

While descending on Airway G452 the crew contacted Delhi: ""Good evening 1907. Passing through 230 for 180, 74 miles from DPN [the Delhi Airport beacon]"". The controller then cleared the flight to descend to and report at FL150. In the meantime, a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 had departed Delhi at 18:32 for a passenger flight to Dhahran. Flight SV763 followed the Parvi SID and reported aproaching FL100. The Delhi controller cleared the flight, which was also on Airway G452, to climb to FL140. Because Flight 1907 was approaching from the opposite side, the controller told SV763: ""Maintain level 140, Standby for higher."" A little later, Flight 1907 reported reaching FL150 at 46 miles from the airport. The controller then responded: ""Roger. Maintain 150. Identified traffic 12 o'clock, reciprocal Saudia Boeing 747, 14 miles. Report in sight."" The Kazakhstan crew replied by querying the distance to which the controller answered: ""Fourteen miles now, roger 1907."" When no reply followed he again warned: ""Traffic in 13 miles, level 140."" Apparently the Kazakh aircraft had descended below its assigned altitude and was flying at 14500 feet. A few seconds later seconds later the Ilyushin had descended another 310 feet. Shortly afterwards both aircraft collided, plummeted down in flames and crashed in an arid farming area.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The root and approximate cause of the collision was the unauthorised descending by the Kazak aircraft to FL-140 and failure to maintain the assigned FL-150.  The factors contributing to the unauthorised descent of Kazak aircraft to FL-140, departing from the assigned FL-150, were: i) inadequate knowledge of English language of Kazak pilot, resulting in wrong interpretations of ATC instructions. ii) poor airmanship and lack of proper CRM (Crew Resource Management) skill on the part of PIC (Pilot-in-Command) compounded by leadership quality lacking in him. iii) Casual attitude of the crew and lack of coordination in the performance of their respective duties by crew of Kazak aircraft. iv) Absence of standard callouts from any crew member."
Thursday 1 September 1983,03:26,Boeing 747-230B,Korean Air Lines - KAL,,269,"37 km W off Sakhalinsk [Okhotsk Sea] - 
	   Pacific Ocean",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"Anchorage International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC)",Seoul-Gimpo (Kimpo) International Airport (SEL/RKSS),"Korean Air Lines flight 007 was a scheduled passenger flight from New York-JFK Airport, USA, to Seoul, South Korea with an en route stop at Anchorage, Alaska, USA.  The aircraft, a Boeing 747-230B, arrived at Anchorage at 11:30 UTC (03:30 hours local time) after an uneventful flight.  A crew change took place and the flight was prepared for the final leg to Seoul. The flight was to depart on the Standard Instrument Departure (SID) No. 8 and to proceed to Bethel VORTAC on ATS route J501. The flight was then to proceed on ATS route R20 in the North Pacific (NOPAC) composite route system to reporting point NIPPI where the flight would enter Tokyo Oceanic FIR and later enter the Taegu FIR for landing at Seoul. Route R20 was adjacent to Soviet airspace along the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands. En route altitude was FL310 with planned changes en route to FL330 after NUKKS and to FL350 after NIPPI.  Departure At 12:58 UTC KE007 was cleared for take-off from runway 32 and was airborne at 13:00. Radar contact was established shortly after take-off and KE007 was cleared to proceed direct to the Bethel VORTAC when able. KE007 turned to a magnetic heading of about 245° which it reached three minutes after lift-off. The Kenai air route surveillance radar showed that the aircraft deviated from its track to BETHEL about ten minutes after departure and that the aircraft was about 6 NM north of J501 when radar service was terminated. The aircraft reported passing BETHEL at 13:49 hours and estimated NABIE at 14:30. The aircraft was about 12 NM north of track when the crew reported BETHEL. After Bethel the flight was supposed to begin following route R20 on a magnetic heading of 238°.  However, The flight proceeded on a magnetic heading of 245° without changing course.  This deviation resulted in a progressively greater lateral displacement to the right of its planned route which, ultimately, resulted in its penetration of adjacent high seas airspace in flight information regions (FIRs) operated by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), as well as of sovereign USSR airspace overlying Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island and their surrounding territorial waters.  First intercept attempt While KE007 was approaching the Kamchatka peninsula, a US Air Force Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft was orbiting the area east off Kamchatka. Soviet Air Defence command assumed that KE007 was an RC-135 as well. At least four interceptor aircraft were scrambled from airfields in Kamchatka and vectored to the west to intercept the intruder. The fighters were unable to make an interception and at 17:06 UTC were forced to return to base. Radar contact with the intruder was lost by radars on Kamchatka at 17:28 UTC. The Soviet Air Defence forces on Sakhalin Island were fully alerted by 17:36 hours and radar contact was established by Sakhalin based radars and from 17:45. At 17:52 the steady track of the contact raised doubts and the command centres questioned as to whether it could be a Soviet aircraft. Two Sukhoi Su-15 fighter aircraft were scrambled from the airbase at Sokol: 805 at 17:42 hours and 121 at 17:54 hours. More interceptors were brought to readiness for immediate take-off at various airbases.   Second intercept At 17:53 hours an order was given to the ground control that the contact was a combat target, which was to be destroyed if it violated the State border. At 17:58 hours interceptor 805 was ordered to follow and identify the target which by that time was about to enter the Bay of Terpenie. At the same time conflicting instructions were given to 805 to hold a position suitable for an immediate attack. 805 and 163 were at altitude and following the contact from 18:00 and 18:08 hours, respectively. Controllers were ordered not to close the interceptors directly astern of the target because of a possible cannon carried in the tail. At 18:08 hours the pilot of 805 reported that he could see the target, at a distance of 4.5 to 5 km, but because of darkness he could not identify the aircraft type. It was suggested that if there were four contrails then it would be an RC-135. At 18:09 hours an order was given to the controller to destroy the target. However, the order was immediately changed to require him to wait until the State border had been violated, because concerns had been expressed about taking action over the high seas. Shortly after 18:12 hours the intruder was interrogated by 805 using the Soviet electronic identification system, but there was no response. At 18:15 hours limitations in radar coverage necessitated the handover of control of the interceptors from one ground control station to another. By 18:16 hours the intruder had re-entered Soviet sovereign airspace and was about to cross the southern end of Sakhalin Island. An officer of the Soviet Air Defence command mentioned at 18:17 hours that the unidentified aircraft might be a passenger aircraft. There was then confusion over whether the intruder aircraft displayed lights. Subsequently the task to destroy the aircraft was confirmed with the comment, ""If there are no lights it cannot be a passenger [aircraft].""  airspace as well as its identity. Unaware of their actual position and the scrambled fighters, the flight crew of KE007 was engaged in casual conversation on the flight deck and in light-hearted exchanges with the flight crew of another flight to Seoul (KE015), before discussing, with the flight crew of KE015, the question of their arrival times in Seoul, the different headwinds being experienced and a change in flight levels. At about 18:15 hours both aircraft were also in contact with Tokyo Radio. At 18:18 hours the pilot of 805 reported, in response to questions from his ground control, that the target's navigation lights and flashing beacon were on. At 18:19 hours the Soviet ground control instructed the pilot of 805 to flash his lights as a warning signal and to force the intruder to land at Sokol. At 18:20 hours he was instructed to fire a warning burst from his cannon. He reported at 18:19 hours having flashed his lights and at 18:21 hours having fired a burst from the cannon. On board KE007 there was no indication that the flight crew was aware in any respect of the interception in progress. Shortly after 18:20 hours KE007 commenced the planned climb from FL330 to FL350 which it reached at 18:23 hours. The pilot of 805 reported that this climb by the target resulted in his aircraft forging ahead into a position where engagement was not possible. At 18:22 hours the Soviet command again ordered the destruction of the target. The time factor became a paramount consideration in the command centres, as the intruder aircraft was about to coast out from Sakhalin Island. Consequently, exhaustive efforts to identify the intruder aircraft were not made, although apparently some doubt remained regarding its identity. The pilot of 805 was instructed to destroy the target with cannon fire but he reported falling back to try with missiles. Two air-to-air missiles were launched by 805 at about 18:25 hours.  The aircraft was struck by one or both missiles, resulting in holes in the fuselage with a total area in the order of 1.75 sq.ft (0.16 m2). As a result of the damage caused by the missile the aircraft initially pitched up and the vertical acceleration increased to approximately 1.2 g over three to five seconds. During this period, the aircraft rolled very slightly right wing down. Eleven seconds after the hit, the sound of the cabin altitude warning was heard in the cockpit. As a result of the likely failure of hydraulic systems no.1, 2 and 3, the aircraft became difficult to  control. The aircraft continued to climb and reached a maximum altitude of 38250 ft with a reduction in calibrated airspeed from the initial 286 kt to 220 kt. After the aircraft started to descend and at the time of temporary recovery to about level flight, it likely stalled.  The aircraft spiralled to the left and the last plotted radar position was at 18:35 UTC (03:35 local time) at 5000 metres. The aircraft subsequently impacted the sea, killing all aboard.  The flight recorders, fragmentary pieces of the aircraft and a small number of items of personal property were salvaged by divers from the USSR during a two month period following the accident. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) tapes were recovered by the USSR in 1983 and were handed over to ICAO in January 1993.  1. The flight crew was properly certificated and qualified for the flight. 2. The flight crew were physically fit but extended time zone crossings and the level of utilization of crew flight and duty times had the potential for one or more of the flight crew to experience fatigue and a reduction of situational awareness. 3. The aircraft was properly certificated and had been maintained in accordance with approved procedures. The aircraft was serviceable when dispatched from Anchorage. 4. There was no indication of an in-flight failure of the navigation systems, the weather radar, the instrumentation or other equipment of the aircraft. 5. The adjustment of the departure time for the flight was in accordance with Korean Air Lines' standard practice. 6. The actual time of departure of KE 007 would have resulted in an on-time arrival in Seoul. 7. KE 007 turned to a magnetic heading of about 245° which it reached three minutes after lift-off and then maintained until the attack. 8. KE 007 passed approximately 6 NM north of Cairn Mountain NDB and 12 NM north of Bethel VORTAC. 9. The maintenance of a constant magnetic heading and the resulting track deviation was due to the crew's failure to note that the autopilot had either been left in heading mode or had been switched to INS when the aircraft was beyond the range (7.5 NM) for the INS to capture the desired track. 10. The maintenance of a constant magnetic heading was not due to any aircraft system malfunction. 11. The autopilot was not controlled by an INS. 12. Manual control of the autopilot was not exercised by the crew by the use of heading selection. 13. The flight crew's failure to detect that the navigation systems had not been selected correctly to maintain the desired track may have been contributed to by inadequate displays of the operative modes selected. 14. The flight crew did not implement the proper navigation procedures to ensure the aircraft remained on its assigned track throughout the flight. 15. The failure to detect the aircraft's deviation from its assigned track for over five hours indicated a lack of situational awareness and flight deck co-ordination on the part of the crew. 16. Korean Air Lines training procedures on the use of INS were adequate. 17. The flight crew had the necessary training and experience in long-range navigation procedures. 18. The deviation from its assigned track resulted in KE 007 penetrating USSR sovereign airspace over Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island and the surrounding territorial waters. 19. According to the representatives of the United States, the military radar installations in Alaska were not aware in real time that the aircraft was proceeding west with an increasing northerly deviation from the recognized airways system. 20. KE 007 proceeded westbound out of the Alaskan ADIZ, through the Alaskan DEWIZ and the Alaskan Air Command buffer zone well north of R20. According to the representatives of the United States, no radar observations were made of a westbound aircraft north of R20 and crossing the Alaskan identification zones. 21. There were no indications that the crew of KE 007 deliberately maintained a constant magnetic heading. 22. There was a normal, relaxed atmosphere on the flight deck of KE 007.  23. The proximity of an RC-135 (a United States intelligence aircraft) and KE 007 northeast of Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in confusion and the assumption by the USSR air defence that the aircraft proceeding towards the USSR was an RC-135. 24. USSR military aircraft attempted to intercept KE 007 over Kamchatka Peninsula.  25. Information was freely available to flight crews that an aircraft penetrating prohibited areas of USSR sovereign airspace over Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island might be fired upon without warning. 26. The USSR air defence command centre personnel on Sakhalin Island were concerned with the position of the intruder aircraft in relation to USSR sovereign airspace as well as its identity. 27. The time factor became paramount in the USSR air defence command c"
Monday 16 January 2017,07:19,Boeing 747-412F,"ACT Airlines, opf Turkish Cargo",46820,4,"1 km W of Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU) - 
	   Kyrgyzstan",Approach,Cargo,Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH),Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU/UCFM),"A Boeing 747-412F cargo plane was destroyed after impacting terrain near Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU). All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed. Flight 6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9°C, dew point -10°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa. The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 07:06 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 07:11 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA. Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 07:12 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart. The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl). At 07:15:21 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control. At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured. At 07:15:31 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl).  A glideslope signal was captured at 07:15:52, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min. Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation. At 07:16:01 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After the glideslope descent was initiated the glideslope pointer was fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots. At 07:16:07, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around. As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots. The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times.  At 07:17:04 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around. At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g. Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire.  Conclusion: The cause of the Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL aircraft accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain (CFIT) at the distance of 930 m beyond the end of the active RWY.  The contributing factors were, most probably, the following: - the insufficient pre-flight briefing of the flight crew members for the flight to Manas aerodrome (Bishkek), regarding the approach charts, as well as the non-optimal decisions taken by the crew when choosing the aircraft descent parameters, which led to the arrival at the established approach chart reference point at a considerably higher flight altitude; - the lack of the crew's effective measures to decrease the aircraft vertical position and its arrival at the established approach chart reference point while the crew members were aware of the actual aircraft position being higher than required by the established chart; - the lack of the requirements in the Tower controllers' job instructions to monitor for considerable aircraft position deviations from the established charts while the pertinent technical equipment for such monitoring was available; - the excessive psycho-emotional stress of the crew members caused by the complicated approach conditions (night time, CAT II landing, long-lasting working hours) and their failure to eliminate the flight altitude deviations during a long time period. Additionally, the stress level could have been increased due to the crew's (especially the PIC's) highly emotional discussion of the ATC controllers' instructions and actions. Moreover, the ATC controllers' instructions and actions were in compliance with the established operational procedures and charts; - the lack of the crew members' monitoring for crossing the established navigational reference points (the glideslope capture point, the LOM and LIM reporting points); - the crew's failure to conduct the standard operational procedure which calls for altitude verification at the FAF/FAP, which is stated in the FCOM and the airline's OM. On the other hand, the Jeppesen Route Manual, used by the crew, contains no FAF/FAP in the RWY 26 approach chart; - the onboard systems' ""capture"" of the false glideslope beam with the angle of 9°; - the design features of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft type regarding the continuation of the aircraft approach descent in the automatic mode with the constant descent angle of 3° (the inertial path) with the maintained green indication of the armed automatic landing mode (regardless of the actual aircraft position in relation to the RWY) while the aircraft systems detected that the glideslope signal was missing (after the glideslope signal ""capture""). With that, the crew received the designed annunciation, including the aural and visual caution alerts; - the absence of the red warning alert for the flight crew in case of a ""false"" glideslope capture and the transition to the inertial mode trajectory, which would require immediate control actions from the part of the crew; - the lack of monitoring from the part of the crew over the aircraft position in regard to the approach chart, including the monitoring by means of the Navigation Display (ND), engaged in the MAP mode; - the crew's failure to conduct the Airline's Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), regarding the performance of the go-around procedure in case the ""AUTOPILOT"" (the AP switching to the inertial mode) and ""GLIDESLOPE"" (the EGPWS annunciation of the significant glideslope deviation) alerts during the automatic CAT II landing at true heights below 1000 ft (with no visual reference established with either the runway environment or with the lighting system); - the delayed actions for initiating the go-around"

The flight departed from McChord Air Force Base with 219 passengers and a crew of 10 aboard. It landed on runway 6L at Anchorage International Airport at 15:32 hours local time. During the landing rollout the captain used reverse thrust and medium heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop on the icy runway. Braking action was fair to poor and only light braking was used while taxiing to the ramp. After the aircraft was parked and chocked at the terminal ramp the parking brakes were released.	 The airplane was refueled with 117,227 pounds of JET-1-A fuel for a computed takeoff gross weight of 349,012 pounds. The allowable takeoff gross weight was 350,000 pounds. Because freezing drizzle was falling, the aircraft was deiced just prior to its departure from the ramp.  The flight departed the ramp at approximately 16:54 and, upon request, received clearance to runway 6R. The takeoff checklist was completed except for the transponder and ignition override items, while the aircraft was being taxied to the runway. The flight was cleared to taxi into position to hold on runway 6R at 17:00:25, and was cleared for takeoff at 17:02:40. The captain stated that after the flight had been cleared into position he taxied slowly onto the runway and stopped the aircraft with the nose pointed slightly to the right of the centerline. He also stated he did not set the parking brakes while on the runway awaiting takeoff clearance and, further, that the parking brakes had not been reset at any time subsequent to brake release at the terminal ramp. The first officer had been previously assigned to make this takeoff and while the aircraft was in position on the runway, the captain briefed the flightcrew that he (the captain) would handle the brakes, set the engine power, and make the necessary airspeed calls attendant with the takeoff. The remaining checklist items were completed by the crew at approximately 17:03. The captain stated that he advanced the power to 80 percent (N2 compressor rpm), released the brakes and said, ""lets go to"" the first officer. He then advanced the throttles to the takeoff power of 1.87 EPR. No movement or sliding of the aircraft was noticed by the crew prior to the brake release. At around 145 knots the acceleration flattened out. Takeoff was continued since there was enough runway length remaining. When VR was called (153 knots) the aircraft was 1800-1500 feet from the end of the runway. The aircraft was rotated but did not leave the ground. After leaving the runway, the captain decided to abort the takeoff. It continued along the ground and struck a low wooden barrier, the instrument landing system (ILS) structure, and a 12-foot deep drainage ditch before coming to a stop approximately 3400 feet beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the intense ground fire which developed subsequent to the crash. Forty-six passengers and one flight attendant received fatal injuries as a result of the post-crash fire.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the aircraft to attain the necessary airspeed to effect lift-off during the attempted takeoff. The lack of acceleration, undetected by the crew until after the aircraft reached V1 speed, was the result of a high frictional drag which was caused by a failure of all main landing gear wheels to rotate. Although it was determined that a braking pressure sufficient to lock all of the wheels was imparted to the brake system, the source of this pressure could not be determined. Possible sources of the unwanted braking pressure were either a hydraulic/brake system malfunction or an inadvertently engaged parking brake."""

All 49 on board the DC-9 and the pilot of the Phantom were killed in the accident.  Flight 706 Hughes Airwest Flight 706 was a regularly scheduled flight from Los Angeles, California, to Seattle, Washington, with intermediate stops at Salt Lake City, Utah, Boise and Lewiston, Idaho, and Pasco and Yakima, Washington. The flight departed Los Angeles International Airport at 18:02 local time and following radar vectors from Los Angeles Departure Control, contacted the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at 18:06. The flight reported leaving 12,000 feet at 18:09, and the controller advised, ""Air West seven zero six red, turn left heading zero four zero until receiving Daggett proceed direct."" RW706 acknowledged, ""OK. zero four zero direct to Daggett."" This was the last recorded transmission from the flight.  Phantom The U.S. Marine Corps F-4B Phantom, 151458, was part of a two-ship formation that had departed the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, California on June 4, 1971 on an overnight cross-country return flight to McChord Air Force Base (AFB), Washington. During a refueling stop at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, on the way back, 151458 was grounded for repairs to have mechanical difficulties checked out. The radar and transponder were inoperative, there as an oxygen system leak and the radar system were degraded. Meanwhile the flight leader continued back to MCAS El Toro. Maintenance personnel replaced a fuse to fix the radio, but they did not have the personnel to check the transponder. They confirmed the oxygen leak, but could not repair it. No attempt was made to restore the radar to peak performance at that time. The crew of 151458 then flew to Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Fallon, Nevada, for further repairs. The maintenance personnel on duty at NAAS Fallon were unable to provide the appropriate repairs, so it was decided that the Phantom should continue to MCAS El Toro at low altitude. The flight departed at 17:16, climbed initially to 7500 feet, and then climbed to 15500 feet to clear mountains and some clouds. After crossing the mountains, they descended to 5500 feet and later further down to 1000 feet. Due to deteriorating visibility, they again climbed to 15500 feet northwest of Palmdale.  The Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) was operating the radar in the mapping mode, but, due to the extremely degraded air-to-air detection capability, no airborne targets were seen.   Collision At 18:11 both crew members of the Phantom jet suddenly noticed the DC-9 on their right hand side. The pilot initiated an evasive roll but a collision could not be avoided. The Phantom struck the forward fuselage of the DC-9, causing the nose section of the DC-9 the separate from the fuselage.  The F-4 began to tumble violently about the lateral axis and the RIO ejected from the aircraft. He parachuted to the ground without injury.  The DC-9 crashed in a wooded canyon with approximately 60° slopes  PROBABLE CAUSE: The failure of both crews to see and avoid each other but it is recognized that they had only marginal capability to detect, assess, and avoid the collision. Other causal factors include a very high closure rate, comingling of IFR and VFR traffic in an area where the limitation of the ATC system precludes effective separation of such traffic, and failure of the crew of BuNo458 to request radar advisory service, particularly considering the fact that they had an inoperable transponder."""

Aeroflot flight 7880, registration CCCP-65735, operated on a flight from Tashkent to Minsk via Donetsk. It departed Donetsk at 13:11 hours. There were seven crew members and 77 passengers on board, including players and coaches of the football team Pakhtakor, heading for a USSR Football Championship game in Minsk.  Aeroflot flight 7628, registration CCCP-65816, operated on a flight from Chelyabinsk to Kishinev (now named Chisinau) via Voronezh. The flight departed Voronezh at 12:54. There were six crew members and 88 passengers on board. At 13:17 flight 7628 entered the Southwest sector of the Kharkiv's regional air traffic control area at an altitude of 8400 m. A request, and two subsequent requests, by the crew to climb to 9600 m were denied because of other traffic in the area. At 13:25, flight 7880 reported entering the sector at 5700 meters and requested to continue their climb to 9600 m. The controller initially cleared the flight to 7200 m and subsequently to 8400 m. Both flights were now at the same altitude, on crossing airways. The controller had calculated that the aircraft would be 3 minutes apart at that point. in fact, this was less than a minute. The supervisor of the Southwest sector noticed this and intervened. At 13:34 the supervisor instructed flight 7880 to climb to 9000 meters. A muffled response was heard by the supervisor, who assumed this was a read back from flight 7780.  At 13:35:38, while in the clouds at an altitude of 8400 meters, both aircraft collided at an angle of 95°. The cockpit of CCCP-65816 collided with the right wing of CCCP-65735. After the collision, both aircraft both aircraft entered a spin and started to break up. The debris fell to the ground in a large area near the villages of Kurilovka, Nikolaevka and Elizavetovka.  Conclusion: the cause of the catastrophe was errors and violations of the requirements of the NPP GA-78, made by the controller of the South-Western sector and the controller-instructor in terms of the appointment of flight levels and ensuring the established intervals between the aircraft, and compliance with the rules of radio exchange phraseology."

	   Russia",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD),Irkutsk Airport (IKT/UIII),"On its last flight on July 8, 2006, the Airbus A310 F-OGYP was released with six defects as per minimum equipment list (MEL), including the deactivated state of the left engine thrust reverser. The previous two flights had been carried out with a deactivated right engine thrust reverser. On July 9, Sibir flight 778 departed Domodeovo (DME) at night for a flight to Irkutsk (IKT). Weather at Irkutsk was poor. It was raining, overcast clouds at 600 feet and a thunderstorm in the area. At 07:38 the co-pilot reported the completion of the final leg at 850 m, whereupon he received instructions to contact Irkutsk tower. The Irkutsk tower controller cleared the crew for an approach to runway 30. Descent to the final approach leg was carried out using the airplane captain's navigational display in VOR mode, and that of the co-pilot in ILS mode, to control the airplane's position relative to the course using indications from the localizer beacon. At 07:40:18 the co-pilot reported: ""Sibir 7-7-8 descending, landing gear down, ready for landing"", whereupon he received the controller's clearance to land. At 07:43:13, 1500 meters short of the runway threshold and at a height of 105 m, the crew disengaged auto-pilot no. 1, and switched off the auto-throttle 2 seconds afterwards. After breaking through the clouds, the captain obtained visual contact with the runway. He made a small elevator deflection to pitch down, which led momentarily to an increase in vertical speed and activation (at 07:43:30, at 30 m), of the ""SINK RATE"" ground proximity warning. At 07:43:40 the captain landed the airplane at a speed of 244 kph (132 knots) at a distance of about 200-300 meters from the runway threshold. Immediately after touchdown, with the spoiler handle armed, all spoiler sections were automatically released. 1.5 seconds after touchdown the reverse thrust lever of the right engine was moved to idle by the captain, and 3 seconds after that, after the reverser doors were in their working position, switched to maximum reverse thrust. Engine reverse thrust then started to increase. In violation of SOPs, the co-pilot did not call out the completion of reverser door movement to the working position (Rev Green). The crew did not activate the reverse thrust lever for the left engine. Afterwards the captain began to shift the reverse thrust lever of the right engine to reduce reverse thrust. Simultaneously with moving the reverse thrust lever of the right engine, the FDR records a change in position of the thrust control lever of the left engine, which in 3 steps, over 16 seconds, increased from 36.6° (idle) to 59° (~60% of the full rated takeoff thrust). The direction and periods of movement of the reverse thrust lever of engine no. 2 to reduce the reverse thrust and the thrust control lever of engine no. 1 to increase forward thrust coincided. Because of the movement of the thrust control lever to a position greater than 10°, the spoilers retracted automatically. Retraction of the spoilers led to the deactivation of the automatic braking mode. At this time the speed was about 180 kph (98 knots) and, on account of the large asymmetry of engine thrust, the airplane started to turn to the right, which the airplane captain counteracted by depressing the left pedal and forcibly applying the brakes. The speed stabilized at 98 knots. At 07:44:21 the crew (most probably the co-pilot) tried once again to deploy the thrust reverser on the right engine, for which he moved the reverse thrust lever of the engine over to maximum reverse thrust but, per design, the location of the thrust control lever for the left engine in a mode higher than 55° prevented the operation, and the thrust reverser doors failed to unlock. The right engine remained at idle forward thrust. After this attempt to deploy the thrust reverser, the airplane started to swerve to the left. The crew attempted to correct this movement and the airplane started to drift to the right.  The right main bogie exited the runway at a speed of 98 knots, and the nose landing gear and the left main bogie moved along the reinforced concrete portion of the runway. The nose landing gear and the left main bogie exited on to the ground at the end of the reinforced concrete runway at 07:44:36. The airplane traveled over clay soil with a grassy cover. At a distance of 210 m from the threshold of runway 12, the left engine destroyed part of the antenna and the wooden fence of the localizer beacon system. At a distance of 250 m from the threshold of runway 12, the airplane crossed an asphalt bypass road. The airplane stopped at 07:44:40 after colliding with a reinforced concrete airport perimeter fence and with brick structures (garages) behind it. The airplane broke apart during the collision and burst into flames.  CONCLUSION: ""The cause of Sibir A-310 F-OGYP accident was the erroneous and uncontrolled actions by the crew during rollout after landing in a configuration with one engine reverser deactivated. After touchdown, the Captain, while acting on the reverse thrust lever of the right engine, inadvertently and uncontrollably moved the throttle lever for the left engine, whose thrust reverser was deactivated, from the ""idle"" to the significant forward thrust position. Inadequate monitoring and call-outs of airplane speed and engine parameters by the Co-pilot made it impossible for the crew to perform the necessary actions, either by moving the left throttle back to idle or shutting down the engines. The crew had enough time to recognize the situation.  The airplane went off the runway at the high speed of ~180 km/h, hit the concrete fence and buildings, crashed and caught fire. 125 people died as a result of the accident."""

The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight. At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged. At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased.

The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt.  At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot.

Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react. Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response. The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door. At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success. As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28. The GPWS then sounded: ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters.  Causes: The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence. The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle: - the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME; - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly; - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality.  Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps."

After contacting Philadelphia Approach Control the crew elected to wait in a holding pattern along with 5 other aircraft because of extreme winds at Philadelphia. Flight 214 entered a holding pattern west of the New Castle VOR on the 270 radial.  At 20:58 the airplane suffered a lightning strike. This caused the initial ignition of flammable fuel vapours inside the left reserve fuel tank. This triggered explosions in the centre and right reserve fuel tanks as well. Fuel spilled and caught fire; the complete left wingtip separated as a result. The aircraft was then seen to crash in flames. A 'Mayday' call was received by Philadelphia Approach as the plane was descending out of control.

Saturday 20 April 1968,20:50,Boeing 707-344C,South African Airways - SAA,238,123,"5 km E of Windhoek-Strijdom International Airport (WDH) - 
	   Namibia",Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Windhoek-Strijdom International Airport (WDH/FYWH),Luanda-4 de Fevereiro Airport (LAD/FNLU),"A Boeing 707-344C passenger jet, registered ZS-EUW, was destroyed in an accident near Windhoek-Strijdom International Airport, Namibia.  The aircraft was operating on South African Airways' flight SA228 from Johannesburg to London via Windhoek, Luanda, Las Palmas and Frankfurt. The first leg of the flight was uneventful. Local weather conditions at Windhoek were fine: there was no cloud and no wind. The night was particularly dark as there was no moon and the horizon was indistinct. At 20:49 the aircraft took off from Windhoek runway 08 into conditions of complete darkness. The aircraft climbed to a height of about 650 feet above ground level.  It leveled off and began to descend. Thirty seconds later, the aircraft flew into the ground at a point some 5,327 metres from the end of the runway. The level of the ground at the point of impact was 179 feet below the airport elevation or approximately 100 feet below the point of lift-off. The impact occurred at a groundspeed of approximately 271 knots. The initial impact was in a slightly left-wing-down attitude. The fuselage and each of the 4 engine pods gouged deep trenches in the ground and the aircraft then began to break up as its momentum carried it onward. Wreckage was strewn over an area some 1,400 metres long and some 200 metres wide, and 2 separate fires broke out, presumably through the ignition of fuel on impact.  In regard to the cause of the accident: (1) The effective cause of the accident was the human factor, and not any defect in the aircraft or in any of the engines or flight instruments. (2) After a normal take- off and retraction of the landing gear, and while the aircraft was approaching an estimated height of 650 feet, the flaps were fully retracted and the engine output reduced from take- off power to climb power. There is no reason to suppose that these steps were not taken in the correct sequence and at the prescribed indicated airspeeds. In that phase of flight these alterations in flap configuration and engine power would have caused the aircraft to level off and then lose height 	(a) unless the pilot checked that tendency and maintained a climbing attitude by appropriate action, or  	(b) until the aircraft gained much more speed. (3) The aircraft levelled off and lost height, and during the short period in which it did so the pilot appears to have acted as if he believed that the aircraft was still climbing. He appears to have altered the stabilizer trim to maintain the aircraft in its same pitch attitude, which he apparently believed was an attitude of climb, but which was in fact an attitude of descent. In that situation, which lasted for about 30 seconds, the aircraft lost approximately 750 feet in height and flew into the ground. (4) The co-pilot failed to monitor the flight instruments sufficiently to appreciate that the aircraft was losing height. The following causes probably contributed in greater or lesser degree to the situation described above: 	(a) take-off into conditions of total darkness with no external visual reference; 	(b) inappropriate alteration of stabilizer trim; 	(c) spatial disorientation; 	(d) pre-occupation with after-take-off checks. The following causes might have contributed in greater or lesser degree: 	(a) temporary confusion in the mind of the pilot on the position of the inertial-lead vertical speed indicator, arising from the difference in the instrument panel layout in the C model of the Boeing 707-344 aircraft, as compared with the A and B models, to which both pilots were accustomed; 	(b) the pilot's misinterpretation, by one thousand feet, of the reading on the drum-type altimeter, which is susceptible to ambiguous interpretation on the thousands scale; 	(c) distraction on the flight deck caused by a bird or bat strike, or some other relatively minor occurrence."

Al 167 passengers and nine crew members on board were killed. The Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSR, had landed on schedule at 00:57 hours local time at Tehran. The return leg back to Kiev was due to depart at 05:15 local time (01:45 UTC).  In the meantime, around 02:15 hours local time in Iran, numerous ballistic missiles were fired from Iran towards U.S. bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by a United States drone strike. As a result this military operation changed the alertness level of Iran's air defense. At approximately 04:00 the military sector informed the civil sector of the country's Airspace Control that only the flights already detected and cleared for flight operations by the defense network could be permitted to start up. This would ensure the correct identification of civil flights by the defense network and avoiding targeting them by mistake. At 05:49 the doors were closed and the aircraft was ready to depart. Two minutes later the flight requested the to start up the engines. After contacting the Area Control Center, the ATC unit requested clearance for the Ukrainian flight at 05:52. The Area Control Center forwarded the request for flight PS752 to the Air Defense Coordination Center, which subsequently issued the clearance accordingly. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29R and commenced the takeoff roll at 06:11. After takeoff the flight contacted Mehrabad Radar and was cleared to climb to FL260 and turn right after reaching 6000 feet, heading direct to the PAROT reporting point. As the aircraft was climbing after departure, it appeared on the air defense system. However, a wrong initialisation procedure of the system's north alignment had induced a 107-degree error in the system. Thus, the direction of objects and targets detected by this system was being observed with an increase of 107 degrees by the operator. At 06:13:56, the air defense unit operator detected a target at his 250-degree azimuth, flying on a 52-degree course. At the same time, PS752 had been flying towards the defense system from a 143-degree azimuth. The aircraft was flying a 309-degree course. At 06:14:21, the operator notified the specifications of the detected target to the Coordination Center over the communication network.  The notification was not communicated successfully. Meanwhile the system operator began analyzing the observable information and categorized the detected target as a threat. At 06:14:41, without receiving any response from the Coordination Center, the air defense unit operator fired a missile at the threatening target he had detected.  Under the applicable procedures, if the defense system operator cannot establish communication with the Coordination Center and does not receive the fire command, they are not authorized to fire.  The missile radio fuse was activated at 06:14:59. At that point flight PS752 was at 8100 feet at a position about 20 km west-northwest of the airport. After the first missile radio fuse was activated, the air defense unit radar still locked on the target, and the defense system kept detecting and tracking it. By observing the continuity of trajectory of detected target, the second missile was fired at the aircraft by the operator of defense system at 06:15:11. At 06:45:24, the last communication between the missile and the defense system was recorded in a place close to the aircraft route. After that, the defense system showed a message indicating the strike had failed, with the aircraft clearing from the radar lock-on after some time. The aircraft turned to the right and about 06:16:11, a fire broke out on the aircraft, which was intensifying. Altitude was lost and at 06:18:23, the aircraft crashed into a playground in Khalajabad near Shahedshahr area, 15 km north of the airport. It disintegrated completely and wreckage was strewn along a 300 m long path.  Cause of the Accident The air defense's launching two surface-to-air missiles at the flight PS752, UR-PSR aircraft the detonation of the first missile warhead in proximity of the aircraft caused damage to the aircraft systems and the intensification of damage led the aircraft to crash into the ground and explode instantly.  Other Contributing Factors - The mitigating measures and defense layers in risk management proved to be ineffective due to the occurrence of an unanticipated error in threat identifications, and ultimately failed to protect the flight safety against the threats caused by the alertness of defense forces."

	   United States of America",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)",Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG),"TWA Boeing 747 N93119 arrived as Flight TW881 from Athens at New York-JFK at 16:31. The airplane was refueled at JFK and remained at gate 27 with the auxiliary power unit (APU) and two of its three air conditioning packs operating for about 2 1/2 hours until it departed as TWA flight 800. The flight was scheduled to depart JFK for Paris about 19:00; however, the flight was delayed because of a disabled piece of ground equipment and concerns about a suspected passenger/baggage mismatch. The aircraft was pushed back from the gate about 20:02. Between 20:05 and 20:07, the flight crew started the Nos. 1, 2, and 4 engines and completed the after-start checklist. The flight crew then received taxi instructions and began to taxi to runway 22R. While the airplane was taxiing, about 20:14, the flight crew started the No. 3 engine and conducted the delayed engine-start and taxi checklists. At 20:18:21, ATC advised the pilots that the wind was out of 240-degrees at 8 knots and cleared flight 800 for takeoff. After takeoff the pilots received a series of altitude assignments and heading changes from New York Terminal Radar Approach Control and Boston ARTCC controllers. At 20:25:41, Boston ARTCC advised the pilots to climb and maintain FL190 and expedite through FL150. At 20:26:24, Boston ARTCC amended TWA flight 800's altitude clearance, advising the pilots to maintain FL130. At 20:29:15, the captain stated, ""Look at that crazy fuel flow indicator there on number four .. see that?"" One minute later Boston ARTCC advised them to climb and maintain FL150. The crew then selected climb thrust. After a every loud sound for a fraction of a second, the CVR stopped recording at 20:31:12. At that moment, the crew of an Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737 flying nearby reported seeing an explosion. The aircraft broke up and debris fell into the sea, 8 miles south off East Moriches.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""An explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system. Contributing factors to the accident were the design and certification concept that fuel tank explosions could be prevented solely by precluding all ignition sources and the design and certification of the Boeing 747 with heat sources located beneath the CWT with no means to reduce the heat transferred into the CWT or to render the fuel vapor in the tank nonflammable."""

	   Netherlands",En route,Cargo,Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM),Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV/LLBG),"El Al flight 1862 departed New York-JFK Airport for a cargo flight to Tel Aviv, Israel via Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-258F, arrived at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport at 14:40 hours local time for a crew change, cargo processing and refueling. The total amount of cargo was 114.7 tons, gross weight of the aircraft 338.3 tons which was 21 tons below the maximum allowable.  The aircraft taxied out to runway 01L at 18:14 and started the takeoff roll at 18:21. At 18:28:30, as the aircraft was climbing through 6500 feet, the no. 3 engine and pylon separated from the wing in an outward and rearward movement, colliding with the no. 4 engine causing this engine and pylon to separate as well. An emergency was declared and the crew acknowledged their intention to return to Schiphol Airport and reported that they had a no. 3 engine failure and a loss of engine thrust of both no. 3 and 4 engine. At 18:28:57 the Amsterdam Radar controller informed the crew that runway 06 was in use with wind from 40 degrees at 21 knots. The crew however requested runway 27 for landing. A straight in approach to runway 27 was not possible because of airplane altitude (5000 feet) and distance to the runway (7 miles). The Amsterdam Arrival controller then instructed the crew to turn right heading 360 degrees and descend to 2000 feet. During this descending turn the flight crew reported that the no. 3 and 4 engine were out and that they were having flap problems. Final clearance was given to turn right heading 270 to intercept the final approach course. When it became apparent that the aircraft was going to overshoot the localizer, the controller informed the crew accordingly and directed them to turn to heading 290 to try and intercept the final approach path again. A further instruction was given for a 310 degree heading change and descent clearance for 1500 feet. These instructions were acknowledged and the crew added that they were experiencing control problems. While reducing speed in preparation for the final approach, control was lost and the aircraft crashed into an eleven-floor apartment building the Bijlmermeer suburb of Amsterdam.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The design and certification of the B747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. Furthermore the system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. This ultimately caused - probably initiated by fatigue in the inboard midspar fuse-pin - the no. 3 pylon and engine to separate from the wing in such a way that the no. 4 pylon and engine were torn off, part of the leading edge of the wing was damaged and the use of several systems was lost or limited. This subsequently left the flight crew with very limited control of the airplane. Because of the marginal controllability a safe landing became highly improbable, if not virtually impossible."""
Friday 3 September 2010,19:41,Boeing 747-44AF (SCD),United Parcel Service - UPS,,2,"16,7 km S of Dubai Airport (DXB) - 
	   United Arab Emirates",Approach,Cargo,Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB),Köln/Bonn-Konrad Adenauer Airport (CGN/EDDK),"A Boeing 747-44AF (SCD) cargo plane, registered N571UP, was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Dubai Airport (DXB), UAE. Both crew members were killed in the crash. On September 3rd 2010, Flight UPS6 arrived from Hong Kong on a scheduled cargo service flight into Dubai (DXB) carrying among other items consignments of cargo that included lithium batteries. There were no declared shipments of hazardous materials onboard the airplane. However, at least three of the shipments contained lithium ion battery packs that met the Class 9 hazardous material criteria. The aircraft was parked at the loading position at 15:35 local time. Several Unit Load Devices (ULD) were offloaded and new ULDs were loaded onto the plane. The flight then took from Dubai at 18:51. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying, the captain was the Pilot Non Flying (PNF) for the sector to Köln/Bonn-Konrad Adenauer Airport (CGN), Germany. The take off and climb out from Dubai was uneventful with the exception of a PACK 1 fault which was reset by the PNF at 18:55. The flight transited from UAE airspace into Bahrain Airspace where, at 19:12, the fire bell alarm sounded on the flight deck. The airplane was approaching top of climb (FL320) at the time. Following the fire bell annunciation, the captain assumed control of the aircraft as PF, and the First Officer reverted to PNF while managing the fire warnings and cockpit checklists. The captain advised Bahrain Air Traffic Control (BAH-C) that there was a fire indication on the main deck of the aircraft. The crew informed BAH-C that they needed to land as soon as possible. BAH-C advised the crew that Doha International Airport (DOH) was at the aircrafts 10 oclock position at 100 NM DME. DOH was the nearest airport at the time the emergency was declared, Dubai (DXB) was approximately 148 NM DME. The captain elected to return to DXB, and following the request to land as soon as possible to BAH-C, the crew declared an emergency. BAH-C acknowledged the request, cleared the aircraft for a series of right hand heading changes back to DXB onto a heading of 106°. At approximately 19:14, the Auto Pilot (AP) disconnected, followed at 19:15 by a second audible alarm similar to the fire bell. At about this time the flight crew put on the oxygen masks and goggles. The crew experienced difficulties communicating via the intercom with the masks on, which interfered with the Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). Following the initiation of the turn back to DXB, having been cleared to 27,000 ft, the crew requested an expedited, immediate descent to 10,000 feet. Following ATC clearance, the flight crew initiated a rapid descent to 10,000 ft. BAH-C advised the crew that the aircraft was on a direct heading to DXB and cleared for landing on DXB runway 12 left at their discretion. The Fire Main Deck checklist was activated. According to the system logic, the cabin began to depressurise, PACKS 2 and 3 shut down automatically, and PACK 2 and 3 positions were then manually selected to OFF on the overhead panel in accordance with the checklist instructions. At 19:15, PACK 1 shut down, with no corresponding discussion recorded on the CVR. A short interval after the AP was disengaged, the captain informed the F/O that there was limited pitch control of the aircraft in the manual flying mode, the captain then requested the F/O to determine the cause of the pitch control anomaly. During the turn back to DXB, the AP was re-engaged, and the aircraft descent was stabilised at 19:17. The captain told the F/O to pull the smoke evacuation handle. This was not part of the Fire Main Deck Non-Normal checklist. The captain informed BAH-C that the cockpit was 'full of smoke' and commented to the F/O about the inability to see the instruments. The captain instructed the F/O to input DXB into the Flight Management System (FMS). The F/O acknowledged the request and commented about the increasing flight deck temperature. It was not clear from the CVR if the FMS was programmed for DXB, although the DFDR indicated that the ILS/VOR frequency was changed to 110.1 MHz which was the frequency for DXB RW12L. Based on the information available to date, it is likely that less than 5 minutes after the fire indication on the main deck, smoke had entered the flight deck and intermittently degraded the visibility to the extent that the flight instruments could not effectively be monitored by the crew. At approximately 19:19, during the emergency descent, at approximately 20,000 ft cabin altitude, the CAPT, as PF, declared a lack of oxygen supply. Following a brief exchange between the captain and F/O regarding the need for oxygen, the captain transferred control of the aircraft to the F/O as PF. Portable oxygen is located on the flight deck and in the supernumerary area, aft of the flight crew's positions when seated. At this point the recorded CVR is consistent with the captain leaving his seat, after which there is no further CVR information that indicates any further interaction from the captain for the remainder of the flight. The normal procedural requirement of transiting into the Emirates FIR, inbound for DXB was a radio frequency change from BAH-C to UAE-C. At 19:20, BAH-C advised the crew to contact UAE-C. At approximately the same time, the PF transmitted mayday, mayday, mayday can you hear me?'. The PF advised BAH-C that due to the smoke in the flight deck, the ability to view the cockpit instruments, the Flight Management System (FMS), Audio Control Panel (ACP) and radio frequency selection displays had been compromised. At 19:21, the PF advised BAH-C that they would stay on the BAH-C frequency as it was not possible to see the radios. The PF elected to remain on the BAH-C radio frequency for the duration of the flight. At approximately 19:22 the aircraft entered the Emirates FIR heading east, tracking direct to the DXB RW12L intermediate approach fix. The aircraft was now out of effective VHF radio range with BAH-C. In order for the crew to communicate with BAH-C, Bahrain advised transiting aircraft that they would act as a communication relay between BAH-C and the emergency aircraft. At 19:22, the F/O informed the relay aircraft that he was looking for some oxygen. Following the rapid descent to 10,000 ft the aircraft leveled off at the assigned altitude approximately 84NM from DXB. At approximately 19:26, the PF requested immediate vectors to the nearest airport and advised he would need radar guidance due to difficulty viewing the instruments. At around 19:33, approximately 26 NM from DXB, the aircraft descended to 9000 ft, followed by a further gradual descent as the aircraft approached DXB, inbound for RW12L. The speed of the aircraft was approximately 340 kts. 19:38, approximately 10NM from RW12L, BAH-C, through the relay aircraft, advised the crew the aircraft was too high and too fast and requested the PF to perform a 360° turn if able. The PF responded Negative. At this time the DFDR data indicated the gear lever was selected down, the speed brake lever moved toward extend and at approximately the same time there was a sound consistent with the flap handle movement; shortly afterward the PF indicated that the landing gear was not functioning. The aircraft over flew the DXB northern airport boundary on a heading of 117°, the aircraft speed and altitude, was 340 kts at an altitude of 4500 ft and descending. Following the over flight of DXB, on passing the south eastern end of RW12L, the aircraft was cleared direct to Sharjah Airport (SHJ) as an immediate alternate  SHJ was to the aircrafts left and the SHJ runway was a parallel vector. The relay pilot asked the PF if it was possible to perform a left hand turn. The PF responded requesting the heading to SHJ. The PF was advised that SHJ was at 095° from the current position at 10 NM and that this left hand turn would position the aircraft on final approach for SHJ (RW30). The PF acknowledged the heading change for SHJ. The PF selected 195° degrees on the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The AP disconnected at 19:40, the aircraft then entered a descending right hand turn at an altitude of 4000 ft as the speed gradually reduced to 240 kts until the impact. Several Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) caution messages were audible on the CVR indicating: Sink Rate, Too Low Terrain and Bank Angle warnings. Radar contact was lost at approximately 19:41. The aircraft crashed 9nm south of DXB onto a military installation near Minhad Air Force Base.  CAUSES: 1. A large fire developed in palletized cargo on the main deck at or near pallet positions 4 or 5, in Fire Zone 3, consisting of consignments of mixed cargo including a significant number of lithium type batteries and other combustible materials. The fire escalated rapidly into a catastrophic uncontained fire. 2. The large, uncontained cargo fire, that originated in the main cargo deck caused the cargo compartment liners to fail under combined thermal and mechanical loads. 3. Heat from the fire resulted in the system/component failure or malfunction of the truss assemblies and control cables, directly affecting the control cable tension and elevator function required for the safe operation of the aircraft when in manual control. 4. The uncontained cargo fire directly affected the independent critical systems necessary for crew survivability. Heat from the fire exposed the supplementary oxygen system to extreme thermal loading, sufficient to generate a failure. This resulted in the oxygen supply disruption leading to the abrupt failure of the Captains oxygen supply and the incapacitation of the captain. 5. The progressive failure of the cargo compartment liner increased the area available for the smoke and fire penetration into the fuselage crown area. 6. The rate and volume of the continuous toxic smoke, contiguous with the cockpit and supernumerary habitable area, resulted in inadequate visibility in the cockpit, obscuring the view of the primary flight displays, audio control panels and the view outside the cockpit which prevented all normal cockpit functioning. 7. The shutdown of PACK 1 for unknown reasons resulted in loss of conditioned airflow to the upper deck causing the Electronic Equipment Cooling [EEC] system to reconfigure to ""closed loop mode"". The absence of a positive pressure differential contributed to the hazardous quantities of smoke and fumes entering the cockpit and upper deck, simultaneously obscuring the crews view and creating a toxic environment. 8. The fire detection methodology of detecting smoke sampling as an indicator of a fire is inadequate as pallet smoke masking can delay the time it takes for a smoke detection system to detect a fire originating within a cargo container or a pallet with a rain cover."

The aircraft, a Boeing 757-200, departed Georgetown Airport at 02:09 hours local time. After departure the flight reported an issue with the hydraulic system. The climb was stopped before reaching FL200 and the aircraft turned back to Georgetown Airport. The aircraft touched down on runway 06 at 02:53 hours. It went off the runway and came to rest across the airport perimeter fence. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The right-hand main landing gear had broken off, and the no.2 (right-hand) engine pivoted forward and upwards. Six persons were injured, according to local media. An eighty-six-year-old passenger died of her injuries on November 16.  MAJOR CAUSE Loss of hydraulic fluid, failure of the pressure switch and subsequent total failure of the hydraulic system (firstly the left and subsequently the right) which affected the deployment of some spoilers, thrust reversers and efficacy of the main brakes caused the aircraft to continue the landing roll at a high-speed resulting in an overrun and excursion and severe damage to the aircraft.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS a) Flight Crew lost main brakes after 'pumping the brakes' several times which bled off main brake pressure, and their failure to use accumulator brake that was available at the time to stop the aircraft after losing the main brakes. b) Setting the flaps to 20° instead of landing flap configuration. This resulted in a higher landing speed and roll and with the combination of loss of main brake pressure due to ""pumping"" the brakes rather than applying and holding the brakes made it difficult to stop the aircraft on the runway. c) Maintenance deficiencies and inadequate maintenance actions regarding the hydraulic system. Leaking hydraulic system. FDR readings indicated a trend of hydraulic system difficulties, more so, during the previous 6 flights before the accident. These maintenance lapses may have led to further deterioration and loss of the hydraulic systems. d) Poor FJA maintenance quality assurance and quality control may have led to the maintenance deficiencies which may have contributed to the ineffective resolution of the hydraulic system leakages and other hydraulic system maintenance issues indicated by the FDR. e) FJA management's lackadaisical attitude and bypassing recommendations from the Director of Maintenance and Quality Assurance Manager may have led to bad culture, unsafe practices and may have furthered improper maintenance. (e) Management's interference may have had an adverse effect on maintenance and safety practices generally. f) The soft mud and loose sand in the overrun area contributed to damage to the aircraft during the excursion."

Of the 113 occupants, 21 were killed. At 06:20 hours local time the engines were started. Immediately thereafter, the flight control surfaces were unlocked, a process which, according to the cockpit voice recorder, was not completed.  The crew did not carry out the necessary check of the warning panel on the condition of the elevator. While taxiing for departure, the captain checked for the second time the movement of the elevators but failed to notice they were locked.  The aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 25L and the engines were adjusted to rated power due to the low take-off mass of 113 tons. At 06:28:05 the aircraft reached VR.  The captain pulled the control column during VR, but the aircraft did not respond. Four seconds later he called out to abort the takeoff. At this time the aircraft had attained a speed of 293 km/h. Instead of using reverse thrust, the flight engineer shut down all four engines. The speed at this time was 303 km/h and the remaining distance to the end of the runway was about 940 meters. The aircraft rolled over the end of the runway at a speed of 262 km/h and slightly to the left of the center line.  During the emergency braking five tires of the main landing gear had been destroyed. The aircaft crossed an excavation pit of 40 cm deep, causing the right main landing gear to collapse. It then collided with a water tank, concrete piles of the airport fence, a road embankment and six trees. At 06:28:37 the aircraft came to rest and burst into flames.

During the descent the approach controller reported the airport pressure being 637 mm Hg. After issuing a further clearance down to 1100 metres, the controller corrected the airport pressure to 637 mm Hg. Erroneously the crew programmed their barometric altimeters using 736 instead of 636 mm Hg, causing a difference in altitude indication of about 1100 metres. Descent was continued at a vertical speed of 10 m/sec. At a height of 270 metres the GPWS alarm began to sound and continued to 19 seconds. Then the flight engineer suddenly informed the captain of the mistake, but no corrective action was taken. Ten seconds later the aircraft struck terrain and crashed.  PROBABLE CAUSE:  - error by the crew in programming both barometric altimeters using the 736 mm Hg pressure instead of the actual 636 mm Hg causing a descent below MDA; - failure to use the radio altimeters, which deprived the crew of additional information about their descent below MDA;  - failure of the crew to respond to the recommendation by the flight engineer to climb; Factors were: - the fact that it was the instructor captain's first flight into Leninakan and the student pilot's (in the right hand seat) first flight on an Il-76; - insufficient crew resource management; - insufficient training of pilots regarding the actions to be taken in case of a GPWS warning"

The flight had been delayed for 40 minutes due to no. 2 engine reverser problems. After a flight of 2 and 17 minutes a the flight was cleared to descend to FL70. Shortly afterwards Faro Approach Control provided the crew with the following weather: wind 15deg./18 kts; 2500 m visibility; thunderstorms with 3/8 clouds at 500 feet, 7/8 clouds at 2300 feet and 1/8 cumulonimbus at 2500 feet, temp. 16deg.

At an altitude of 303 m and 140 knots speed the approach became unstable and at 177 m the first officer switched the autopilot from CMD (command mode) to CWS (control-wheel steering). One minute later it was switched from CWS to manual and the airspeed began falling below approach reference speed. About 3-4 seconds short of touchdown elevator was pulled to pitch up and engine power was increased. When the no. 3 and 5 spoilers extended, the aircraft had a 25deg. bank, left wing up.

The right wing separated while the aircraft slid down the runway. The aircraft came to rest 1100 m from the runway 11 threshold and 100 m to the right of the centreline and caught fire.  PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The high rate of descent in the final phase of the approach and the landing made on the right landing gear, which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft.; The crosswind, which exceeded the aircrafts limits and which occurred in the final phase of the approach and during landing. The combination of both factors determined stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. Contributing factors were: The instability of the approach; the premature power reduction, and the sustaining of this condition, probably due to crew action; the incorrect wind information delivered by Approach Control; the absence of an approach light system; the incorrect evaluation by the crew of the runway conditions; CWS mode being switched off at approx. 80ft RA, causing the aircraft to be in manual control in a critical phase of the landing; the delayed action of the crew in increasing power; the degradation of the lift coefficient due to heavy showers."" (DGAC Portugal)  The Netherlands Aviation Safety Board commented that the probable cause should read: ""a sudden and unexpected wind variation in direction and speed (windshear) in the final stage of the approach. Subsequently a high rate of descent and an extreme lateral displacement developed, causing a hard landing on the right-hand main gear, which in combination with a considerable crab angle exceeded the aircraft structural limitations. Contributing factors: From the forecast and the prevailing weather the crew of MP495 did not expect the existence of windshear phenomena.; The premature large power reduction and sustained flight idle thrust, most probable due to crew action.; CWS mode being disengaged at approx. 80ft RA, causing the aircraft to be in manual control at a critical stage in the landing phase."""

At the Oscar 4 intersection NW1482 turned right, but entered the active runway 03C instead of taxiway Xray.  Suddenly both pilots found out they had taxied the wrong way, and contacted ground control.

The flight proceeded routinely to Cincinnati from where it departed at 15:15 hours local time. An IFR clearance was received to Indianapolis via airway V-97 at an altitude of 10,000 feet. At 15:22 the Indianapol1s Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) controller advised, ""Allegheny e1ght fifty three is in radar contact, cross Shelbyville (VOR) at and maintain six thousand and your position now thirty-two miles (unintelligible) ... southeast of Shelbyville."" Approximately 3 minutes later, the flight reported leaving 10,000 feet, and during its descent, was instructed to contact Indianapolis Approach Control. At 15:27, the approach controller advised, ""Allegheny eight five three roger, squawk ident heading two eight zero radar vector visual approach three one left."" Allegheny 853 acknowledged the vector and was, almost immediately instructed to descend to 2,500 feet. The flight acknowledged at 15:27:29, ""Eight five three cleared down two thousand five hundred and report reaching."" This was the last recorded transmission from the flight. At the same time a Piper PA-28-140, N7374J, was operating in the area on a solo training flight from Brookside Airpark, Indiana, to Bakalar Air Force Base. The aircraft was on a VFR flight plan indicating a cruising altitude of 3,500 feet. The pilot advised the Indianapolis Flight Service Station at 15:21 that he had departed Brookside, requesting activation of his flight plan. This was the last known communication with N7374J.  The approach controller did not notice any conflicting traffic in the area of Allegheny 853. Yet both aircraft were on a converging course, with the DC-9 descending towards the altitude of the PA-28.  After the DC-9 broke through the clouds, both flights had a window of 14 seconds to see and avoid. The NTSB determined that the captain, from his position, was unable to see the Piper. The first officer was likely monitoring the altimeter in preparation for a 3500 feet altitude call. Two seconds after this call, both aircraft collided. The initial impact between the two aircraft occurred at the forward upper right side of the vertical fin just below the horizontal stabilizer, of the DC-9, and the left forward side of the PA-28, just forward of the left wing root. The horizontal stabilizer of the DC-9 broke off and the aircraft impacted the ground inverted, almost wings-level, in a nose-down attitude. The Piper broke up and crashed about 4500 feet from the DC-9. All 82 occupants of the DC-9 and the pilot of the PA-28 were killed.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The deficiencies in the collision avoidance capability of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system of the Federal Aviation Administration in a terminal area wherein there was mixed Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic. The deficiencies included the inadequacy of the see-and-avoid concept under the circumstances of this case; the technical limitations of radar in detecting all aircraft; and the absence of Federal Aviation Regulations which would provide a system of adequate separation of mixed VFR and IFR traffic in terminal areas."""

	   Spain",Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD/LEMD),Las Palmas-Airport de Gran Canaria (LPA/GCLP),"An MD-82 passenger plane, registered EC-HFP, was destroyed when it crashed on takeoff at Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD), Spain. Of the aircrafts occupants, 154 were killed, including all six crew members. Eighteen passengers were seriously injured. The MD-82 aircraft operated Spanair flight JK5022 from Madrid-Barajas (MAD) to Gran Canaria (LPA). The estimated departure time was 13:00. The aircraft was authorized by control for engine start-up at 13:06:15. It then taxied to runway 36L from parking stand T21, which it occupied on the apron of terminal T2 at Barajas. The flaps were extended 11°. Once at the runway threshold, the aircraft was cleared for takeoff at 13:24:57. The crew informed the control tower at 13:26:27 that they had a problem and that they had to exit the runway. At 13:33:12, they communicated that they were returning to the stand. The crew had detected an overheating Ram Air Temperature (RAT) probe. The aircraft returned to the apron, parking on remote stand R11 of the terminal T2 parking area. The crew stopped the engines and requested assistance from maintenance technicians to solve the problem. The mechanic confirmed the malfunction described in the ATLB, checked the RAT probe heating section of the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) and opened the electrical circuit breaker that connected the heating element. Once complete, it was proposed and accepted that the aircraft be dispatched.  The aircraft was topped off with 1080 liters of kerosene and at 14:08:01 it was cleared for engine start-up and to taxi to runway 36L for takeoff. The crew continued with the tasks to prepare the airplane for the flight. The conversations on the cockpit voice recorder revealed certain expressions corresponding to the before engine start checklists, the normal start list, the after start checklist and the taxi checklist. During the taxi run, the aircraft was in contact with the south sector ground control first and then with the central sector. On the final taxi segment the crew concluded its checks with the takeoff imminent checklist. At 14:23:14, with the aircraft situated at the head of runway 36L, it was cleared for takeoff. Along with the clearance, the control tower informed the aircraft that the wind was from 210° at 5 knots. At 14:23:19, the crew released the brakes for takeoff. Engine power had been increased a few seconds earlier and at 14:23:28 its value was 1.4 EPR. Power continued to increase to a maximum value of 1.95 EPR during the aircrafts ground run. The CVR recording shows the crew calling out ""V1"" at 14:24:06, at which time the DFDR recorded a value of 147 knots for calibrated airspeed (CAS), and ""rotate"" at 14:24:08, at a recorded CAS of 154 knots. The DFDR recorded the signal change from ground mode to air mode from the nose gear strut ground sensor. The stall warning stick shaker was activated at 14:24:14 and on three occasions the stall horn and synthetic voice sounded in the cockpit: ""[horn] stall, [horn] stall, [horn] stall"". Impact with the ground took place at 14:24:23. During the entire takeoff run until the end of the CVR recording, no noises were recorded involving the takeoff warning system (TOWS) advising of an inadequate takeoff configuration. During the entire period from engine start-up while at parking stand R11 to the end of the DFDR recording, the values for the two flap position sensors situated on the wings were 0°. The length of the takeoff run was approximately 1950 m. Once airborne, the aircraft rose to an altitude of 40 feet above the ground before it descended and impacted the ground. During its trajectory in the air, the aircraft took on a slight left roll attitude, followed by a fast 20° roll to the right, another slight roll to the left and another abrupt roll to the right of 32°. The maximum pitch angle recorded during this process was 18°. The aircrafts tailcone was the first part to impact the ground, almost simultaneously with the right wing tip and the right engine cowlings. The marks from these impacts were found on the right side of the runway strip as seen from the direction of the takeoff, at a distance of 60 m, measured perpendicular to the runway centerline, and 3207.5 m away from the threshold, measured in the direction of the runway. The aircraft then traveled across the ground an additional 448 m until it reached the side of the runway strip, tracing out an almost linear path at a 16° angle with the runway. It lost contact with the ground after reaching an embankment/drop-off beyond the strip, with the marks resuming 150 m away, on the airport perimeter road, whose elevation is 5.50 m lower than the runway strip. The aircraft continued moving along this irregular terrain until it reached the bed of the Vega stream, by which point the main structure was already in an advanced state of disintegration. It is here that it caught on fire. The distance from the initial impact site on the ground to the farthest point where the wreckage was found was 1093 m.  CAUSES: The crew lost control of the airplane as a consequence of entering a stall immediately after takeoff due to an improper airplane configuration involving the non-deployment of the slats/flaps following a series of mistakes and omissions, along with the absence of the improper takeoff configuration warning. The crew did not identify the stall warnings and did not correct said situation after takeoff. They momentarily retarded the engine throttles, increased the pitch angle and did not correct the bank angle, leading to a deterioration of the stall condition. The crew did not detect the configuration error because they did not properly use the checklists, which contain items to select and verify the position of the flaps/slats, when preparing the flight. Specifically: - They did not carry out the action to select the flaps/slats with the associated control lever (in the ""After Start"" checklist); - They did not cross check the position of the lever or the status of the flap and slat indicating lights when executing the"" After Start"" checklist; - They omitted the check of the flaps and slats during the ""Takeoff briefing"" item on the ""Taxi"" checklist; - The visual check done when executing the ""Final items"" on the ""Takeoff imminent"" checklist was not a real check of the position of the flaps and slats, as displayed on the instruments in the cockpit. The CIAIAC has identified the following contributing factors: - The absence of an improper takeoff configuration warning resulting from the failure of the TOWS to operate, which thus did not warn the crew that the airplane's takeoff configuration was not appropriate. The reason for the failure of the TOWS to function could not be reliably established. - Improper crew resource management (CRM), which did not prevent the deviation from procedures in the presence of unscheduled interruptions to flight preparations."

The weather at the time was slightly misty with intermittent drizzle but there was reasonable visibility.  The aircraft was cleared to descend to FL210 after passing latitude 50 °N and was given a routeing via Ibsley and Dunsfold. After passing conflicting traffic, the aircraft was recleared to FL110 and directed to turn right on to 060° for Dunsfold. Passing abeam Fawley the aircraft was further cleared to FL60 and, in acknowledging this instruction, the crew reported leaving FL145. Just under 4 minutes later the aircraft was cleared to proceed direct to Epsom on its own navigation. The flight crew acknowledgement this instruction. All the while the aircraft had been in a continuous descent, until it impacted trees on the southern slope of Blackdown Hill, approximately 48 km south-southwest of Heathrow Airport. The aircraft continued for hundreds of yards, passing across a meadow where it killed 65 grazing sheep. It then broke through a large hedge and parts of the aircraft fell off destroying a garage, and damaging parts of the roof of Upper Blackdown House as the aircraft disintegrated. Accident investigators failed to find the reason for the continued descent. A possible misreading of the altimeters was examined in detail. The aircraft was fitted with threepointer altimeters with warnings to indicate when the aircraft was below 10,000ft. The aircraft descended continuously at a steady rate over a period of 13 1/2 minute and the pointers would have been in continuous motion throughout, increasing the likelihood of misreading. The cross hatching in this type of altimeter first appears in a window in the 10,000ft disc at an indicated altitude of 26,666ft and the edge of the cross hatching would have been visible within 2 minutes of the aircraft beginning its descent. At 10,000 feet the cross hatching completely fills the window and it remains filled as long as the aircraft is below 10,000ft. Thus the cross hatching would have been visible to the crew for a period of about 9 1/2 minutes before the aircraft passed through FL60. According to the investigation report, it is not difficult to read an indication of 6,000ft as 16,000ft with this type of altimeter if particular note is not made of the position of the 10,000ft pointer. Evidence against the possibility of a simple misreading of this sort is the message from the aircraft to ATC reporting passing FL145. indicating that at this time the crew knew that they were below 16,000ft. This evidence indicates that down to this level there had been no misreading or misinterpretation but it does not dispose of the possibility that the crew subsequently suffered a mental loss  of sequence and transposed themselves in time and space back to some altitude above 16,000ft. This has been known to, happen in the past, the investigators noted. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to show that it happened on this occasion.""  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was due to the aircraft having continued to descend through its assigned flight level down to the ground. No reason could be established for the continued descent."""

	   Sudan",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Damascus International Airport (DAM/OSDI),Khartoum-Civil Airport (KRT/HSSS),"An Airbus A310-324 passenger plane, registered ST-ATN, was destroyed in an accident at Khartoum-Civil Airport, Sudan. There were 203 passengers and 11 crew members on board. One crew member and 29 passengers were killed. The aircraft was operated with a deactivated no. 1 engine reverser as per Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures, being a carry forward defect. This was accepted by the pilot who operated the return flight from Khartoum to Amman. Sudan Airways Flight 109 was the return leg from Amman, Jordan to Khartoum, Sudan with an en route stop at Damascus, Syria. The airplane diverted to Port Sudan due to inclement weather at Khartoum. After staying on ground at Port Sudan for about 1:15 hour, and being informed that the weather was getting better, the captain decided to continue to Khartoum.  Weather was poor with CB clouds and a thunderstorm as the Airbus approached Khartoum. The flight was cleared to land on runway 36 with wind information given as 320 degrees at 7 knots. In reality however, there was a 15 knot tail wind. The runway was reported being wet.  The Airbus touched down 900 metres past the runway threshold and the captain selected both thrust reversers to maximum reverse. Reverser no. 2 deployed normally and no. 1 remained stowed. Because of asymmetrical reverse, the airplane skidded to the right. Ten seconds after touch down both reversers were stowed and thrust levers were set to idle. The captain put the aircraft back to the centre line by using differential braking. The captain then switched the anti-skid off and applied full braking on both pedals, causing the wheels to lock. The aircraft longitudinally overran the runway and came to a stop 215 meters after the runway end. Then it caught fire on its right side. Fire services arrived late at the scene of the accident due to acute shortage in fire fighting personnel, and the fact that there was no means of communication between the fire station and the vehicles.  Cause of the accident: ""The accident was due to a long flaring distance (900 meters from R/W threshold) on a wet slippery runway without selecting Auto brake and with one deactivated engine reverse in such rainy conditions. The remaining available landing distance turned out to be too short to allow the captain to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway.  Contributing factors:  The wind information was not appropriate as it was tail wind at time of landing. The crew was not aware about the aircraft ground speed and the tail wind."""

About 21:02 CDT the flight departed Mobile on an IFR flight plan to Pensacola and climbed to the cruising altitude of 7,000 feet. At 21:09, the crew were told that they would be vectored for an airport surveillance radar (ASR) approach to runway 25. At 21:13, the radar controller told National 193 that it was 11 nm NW of the airport and cleared it to descend and maintain 1700 feet. At 21:17 flaps were selected at 15deg and two minutes later the flight was cleared to descend to 1500 feet and shortly after that further down to the MDA (480 feet). As the aircraft rolled out on the final approach heading, the captain called for the landing gear and the landing final checklist. At 21:20:15, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) whooper warning continued for nine seconds until the first officer silenced the warning. Nine seconds later the 727 hit the water with gear down and flaps at 25deg. It came to rest in about 12 feet of water. The weather at the time of the accident was 400 feet overcast, 4 miles visibility in fog and haze, wind 190deg/7 kts.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flightcrew's unprofessionally conducted nonprecision instrument approach, in that the captain and the crew failed to monitor the descent rate and altitude, and the first officer failed to provide the captain with required altitude and approach performance callouts. The captain and first officer did not check or utilize all instruments available for altitude awareness and, therefore, did not configure the aircraft properly and in a timely manner for the approach. The captain failed to comply with the company's GPWS flightcrew response procedures in a timely manner after the warning began. The flight engineer turned off the GPWS warning 9 seconds after it began without the captain' s knowledge or consent. Contributing to the accident was the radar controller's failure to provide advance notice of the start-descent point which accelerated the pace of the crew's cockpit activities after the passage of the final approach fix."""

Sunday 14 August 2005,12:03,Boeing 737-31S,Helios Airways,17900,121,"2 km from Grammatikos - 
	   Greece",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Larnaca Airport (LCA/LCLK),Athens-Elefthérios Venizélos International Airport (ATH/LGAV),"Helios' Boeing 737-300 5B-DBY underwent maintenance on the night prior to the accident. The pressurization system was checked, but after completion of the tests the Pressurization Mode Selector (PMS) was reportedly left in the ""Manual"" position instead of the ""Auto"" mode. In manual mode the crew had to manually open or close the outflow valves in order to control the cabin pressure. The outflow valves were one-third in the open position which meant that the cabin would not pressurize after takeoff. The PMS mode was apparently not noted during the pre-departure checks by the crew. In the morning the 737 was to operate Flight 522 from Larnaca to Prague, Czech Republic with an intermediate stop at Athens, Greece. The flight departed Larnaca at 09:07 for the leg to Athens with a planned flying time of 1 hour and 23 minutes. As the airplane climbed over the Mediterranean the cabin altitude alert horn sounded. This occurred as the 737 passed through an altitude of 10,000 feet. Cabin altitude is usually held around 8,000 feet. The crew possibly thought it was an erroneous takeoff configuration warning because the sound is identical. Then, at 14,000 feet, the oxygen masks automatically deployed and a master caution light illuminated in the cockpit. Because of a lack of cooling air another alarm activated, indicating a temperature warning for the avionics bay. The German captain and the Cypriot co-pilot tried to solve the problem but encountered some problems communicating with each other. They contacted the Helios´ maintenance base to seek advice. The engineer told that they needed to pull the circuit breaker to turn off the alarm. The radio contact ended as the aircraft climbed through 28 900 ft. The circuit breaker was located in a cabinet behind the captain. The captain got up from his seat to look for the circuit breaker. The crew were not wearing their oxygen masks as their mindset and actions were determined by the preconception that the problems were not related to the lack of cabin pressure. As the airplane was still climbing the lack of oxygen seriously impaired the flight crew. The captain probably became unconscious when he was trying to find the circuit breaker. The first officer was still in his seat when he also became unconscious. Because the plane's autopilot was programmed for FL340 the Boeing continued to climb until leveling out at that altitude some 19 minutes after takeoff. At 09:37 the 737 entered the Athens FIR but not contact was established with the flight. Over Rodos at about 09:52 the airplane entered the UL995 airway. At 10:21 the airplane passed the KEA VOR, which is located about 28 nm south of the Athens airport. The airplane then passed the Athens Airport and subsequently entered the KEA VOR holding pattern at 10:38. All efforts by Greek air traffic controllers to contact the pilots were futile. Around 11:00 two Greek F-16 fighter planes were scrambled from the Néa Anghialos air base. At 11:24, during the sixth holding pattern, the F-16's intercepted the airliner. The F-16 pilots reported that they were not able to observe the captain, while the first officer seemed to be unconscious and slumped over the controls.  At 11:49, the F-16's reported a person not wearing an oxygen mask entering the cockpit and occupying the captain's seat. The F-16 pilot tried to attract his attention without success. At 11:50, the left engine flamed out due to fuel depletion and the aircraft started descending. At 11:54, two Mayday messages were recorded on the CVR.  At 12:00, the right engine also flamed out at an altitude of approximately 7100 feet. The aircraft continued descending rapidly and impacted hilly terrain. The same Boeing 737, 5B-DBY, suffered a loss of cabin pressure on December 20, 2004 during a flight from Warsaw to Larnaca. Three passengers needed medical treatment after landing in Larnaca. This incident was caused by a leaking door seal of the right hand rear door.  DIRECT CAUSES: 1. Non-recognition that the cabin pressurization mode selector was in the MAN (manual) position during the performance of the: a) Preflight procedure; b) Before Start checklist; and c) After Takeoff checklist. 2. Non-identification of the warnings and the reasons for the activation of the warnings (cabin altitude warning horn, passenger oxygen masks deployment indication, Master Caution), and continuation of the climb. 3. Incapacitation of the flight crew due to hypoxia, resulting in continuation of the flight via the flight management computer and the autopilot, depletion of the fuel and engine flameout, and impact of the aircraft with the ground. LATENT CAUSES 1. The Operators deficiencies in organization, quality management and safety culture, documented diachronically as findings in numerous audits. 2. The Regulatory Authoritys diachronic inadequate execution of its oversight responsibilities to ensure the safety of operations of the airlines under its supervision and its inadequate responses to findings of deficiencies documented in numerous audits. 3. Inadequate application of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles by the flight crew. 4. Ineffectiveness and inadequacy of measures taken by the manufacturer in response to previous pressurization incidents in the particular type of aircraft, both with regard to modifications to aircraft systems as well as to guidance to the crews. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE ACCIDENT: 1. Omission of returning the pressurization mode selector to AUTO after un-scheduled maintenance on the aircraft. 2. Lack of specific procedures (on an international basis) for cabin crew procedures to address the situation of loss of pressurization, passenger oxygen masks deployment, and continuation of the aircraft ascent (climb). 3. Ineffectiveness of international aviation authorities to enforce implementation of corrective action plans after relevant audits."

Approximately one hour and forty minutes into the flight the airplane encountered ""wave action"" and the captain turned the seatbelt sign on as a precaution. The captain also radioed Northwest flight 90, ahead of him, requesting a ride report. NW 90 reported that the ride was smooth with an occasional ripple of light turbulence at their altitude. The first turbulence encounter happened no more than one to two minutes later. The aircraft encountered severe turbulence about 2 minutes after the ""wave activity."" Seconds later, the flight experienced another turbulence episode. During the turbulence, the captain made a PA announcement for the flight attendants to sit down and then he made a PA announcement to the passengers telling them not to be alarmed. The captain ordered the first officer to reduce speed, and he complied by reducing the indicated airspeed to approximately 330-340 knots IAS. During the encounters, the Boeing moved upwards at 1,8g, sideways (0,1g lateral) and down again 6 seconds later (-0,8g). Before and after the turbulence encounters, the captain saw a band of clouds with no lightning to the right and below the aircraft, but he did not see any lightning or clouds along the route of flight. At the point at which the captain requested permission from ATC to climb to FL330, he asked the purser to provide him with information about the conditions in the cabin following the turbulence. The purser informed the captain that a flight attendant was in the aisle, the cabin was ""a mess"", and there were several injuries. The captain then asked the purser to see if a doctor was on board. Two doctors were found who asked for and were given the airplane's medical kit, oxygen bottles and first aid kits. One doctor stayed with the flight attendants in the back of the cabin who were performing CPR on an unconscious passenger. The other doctor assisted the flight attendants who were providing first aid to other passengers. Upon making an assessment of the injuries and determining that the aircraft had not sustained structural damage, the captain made the decision to return to Narita for medical assistance. The Boeing 747 was declared damaged beyond repair because the plane would have been taken out of service early 1998 anyway.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot-in-command's inadvertent flight into adverse weather conditions, and the difficulty of obtaining adequate weather forecasts of over-ocean turbulence. Factors contributing to the accident include the presence of clear air turbulence, and the failure of the flight attendant to issue a safety advisory."""

All 69 on board the Tu-154 and both crew members of the Boeing 757 were killed in the accident.  Bashkirian flight BTC2937 operated on a charter flight from Moscow (DME) to Barcelona (BCN), Spain. The aircraft departed Moscow at 18:48 UTC and climbed to the planned cruising altitude of FL360. Five flight crew members were in the cockpit. The commander (under supervision) - who was the PF (Pilot flying) on this flight - occupied the left-hand seat. The right-hand seat was occupied by an instructor, who as a PNF (Pilot non flying) also conducted the radio communications. He was also the pilot-in-command (PIC). The seat of the flight navigator was between and slightly behind the pilots. The work station of the flight engineer was behind the instructor. A further pilot (copilot), who had no function on this flight, was on a vacant seat behind the commander.  DHL flight DHX611 departed from Bahrain 13:30 UTC on a cargo flight to Bergamo (BGY), Italy to Brussel (BRU), Belgium.  The flight landed at Bergamo Airport at 19:10 UTC. The airplane was refuelled, unloaded and reloaded with cargo. Take-off for the last leg to Brussels was at 21:06 UTC. The airplane was flown by the copilot (PF).   At 21:21 flight DHX611 contacted ACC Zurich, and received clearance to climb to FL320 and subsequently to the planned cruising altitude of FL360. At 21:29 the airplane reached this flight level, without the pilots reporting it. At 21:30 flight BTC2937 contacted ACC Zurich, and reported they were at FL360. From about 21:33 a discussed ensued among the crew on the Tu-154 concerning an airplane approaching from the left which was displayed on the vertical speed indicator (VSI/TRA) which is part of the TCAS. The crew strived to localize the other airplane as to its position and its flight level. Meanwhile, on board DHX611, the copilot had handed over the control of the airplane to the PIC in order to go to the lavatory. At 21:34:31 the PIC confirmed that he had taken over. At 21:34:42 the airborne TCAS on board both flights alarmed the crews about possibly conflicting traffic by a Traffic Advisory (TA): traffic, traffic"".  Seven seconds later the radar controller issued descent instructions to flight 2937: ""Descend flight level 350, expedite, I have crossing traffic"". This descent was necessary for continuation of the flight to Barcelona and to achieve a vertical separation with respect to the approaching DHL Boeing 757.  At 23:42:56 the crews of both aircraft received a Resolution Advisory (RA)-command from their TCAS. The DHL crew complied with this and initiate a descent. At the same time the Tupolev crew were trying to deal with the conflicting descent (by ATC) and climb (TCAS) instructions. Seven seconds after the Resolution Advisory-command, the ACC Zurich controller repeated the instruction to descend. The Bashkirian crew then decided to follow the controller's instructions. A little later the TCAS aboard the Boeing 757 gave the crew a Resolution Advisory to ""increase descent"". At that time the First Officer had returned to his seat. They then contacted ATC, reporting that they were doing a TCAS descent.  Since both aircraft were descending, the TCAS of the Russian plane warned the crew to ""increase climb"" to avoid a collision. This was eight seconds before the collision. Just prior to the collision, both crews detected the other aircraft, and reacted to avoid the collision by attempting appropriate flight manoeuvres. Nevertheless, at 23:35:32 both aircraft collided at approximately FL354. The tail fin of the Boeing 757 struck the left side of the Tupolev 154 fuselage near both overwing emergency exits, while the Tupolev's left wing sheared off 80% of the Boeing's tail fin. The Tupolev immediately broke up in four pieces (left wing, right wing, main fuselage and tail unit including the engines). The Boeing 757 lost control and crashed 8 km north of the Tupolev, just after losing both engines.  At the night of the accident, from 21:00 UTC, the configuration of the radar data processing of ACC Zurich was modified in order to re-arrange the control sectors.  During this time the radar system was operated in the ""fallback mode"" and the separation minimum had been increased from 5 to 7 NM. In doing so the MV9800 radar computer was not available to the controllers, therefore no automatic correlation of the flight targets was possible and the optical STCA (Short Term Conflict Alert) was not displayed anymore. After the air traffic flow had decreased one controller retired to rest at about 21:15. From then on one controller was solely responsible for the entire ATC within ACC Zurich. For this he had to fill two adjacent workstations with different frequencies and worked with two radar monitors. In order to control flights in the upper airspace and the approach in the lower airspace to Friedrichshafen. During the last five minutes prior to the collision, the controller paid more attention to the Airbus A320 in approach to Friedrichshafen. At 21:33:24 the radar controller of UAC Karlsruhe was alerted by his STCA of the conflict situation. His attempts to warn the controller of ACC Zurich by phone were not successful as a telephone connection could not be established.  A Russian man who had lost his family in the accident held the controller responsible and killed him at his home in Kloten, near Zürich, on 24 February 2004.  CAUSES:  The following immediate causes have been identified: - The imminent separation infringement was not noticed by ATC in time. The instruction for the TU154M to descend was given at a time when the prescribed separation to the B757-200 could not be ensured anymore. - The TU154M crew followed the ATC instruction to descend and continued to do so even after TCAS advised them to climb. This manoeuvre was performed contrary to the generated TCAS RA. The following systemic causes have been identified: - The integration of ACAS/TCAS II into the system aviation was insufficient and did not correspond in all points with the system philosophy. The regulations concerning ACAS/TCAS published by ICAO and as a result the regulations of national aviation authorities, operational and procedural instructions of the TCAS manufacturer and the operators were not standardised, incomplete and partially contradictory. - Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company did not ensure that during the night all open workstations were continuously staffed by controllers. - Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company tolerated for years that during times of low traffic flow at night only one controller worked and the other one retired to rest."

The aircraft broke up and burst into flames as it proceeded up a hill before crashing into a residential area. All 126 on board died in the accident, along with 24 persons on the ground. One passenger, a 22 year old male initially survived the crash but died on September 11, eight days after the accident.  Probable cause (translated from Spanish): 1) The existence of an adverse atmospheric phenomenon of windshear at low altitude, of which existence the captain did not know. 2) An unwise decision of the pilot in command to not postpone the takeoff given the existing weather conditions near the airfield."

An en route stop was made at Kokand, Uzbekistan. The flight departed at 10:36 hours and climbed to the en route altitude of FL270. At 11:20 hours the aircraft was cleared to descend FL250 and subsequently to FL230. During the descent the flaps were set at 30° and the spoilers at 20°. The aircraft was then cleared to descend to FL190, after which the controller instructed the flight to maintain that altitude as an Afghanistan Air Force Antonov An-32 was crossing at FL180. This delayed the descent and the flight leveled off at FL190. Subsequently the flight was cleared down to FL140 and to position for the final approach. At 11:30 the aircraft stalled and rolled left, entering a steep descending spiral. It struck the ground inverted.  The stall of an airplane during maneuvering occurred as a result of a combination of the following factors: - crew failure to maintain flight speed modes recommended by IL-76 for various airplane configurations, which reduced the available margin of angle of attack to critical modes; - insufficient control of crew members over the determining flight parameters, which led to a violation of the established restrictions on the permissible angle of attack and the minimum flight speed; - the lack of piloting skills at high angles of attack, due to the imperfection of the training system for crews in special flight situations; - the pilots were unable to recognize the exit to critical angles of attack and implement the IL-76 recommendations to prevent stall; - the need for maneuvering according to the descent scheme in combat conditions at close to flight restriction conditions and the presence of three aircraft flying in clouds at short intervals without appropriate radar control created a difficult situation for the crew, which was aggravated after the controller informed about the need to temporarily stop the descent in connection with the take-off of the An-32 aircraft, which led to a change in the prevailing stereotype of crew actions."

The crew taxied to runway 16 and were instructed by the Tower controller to hold short. After waiting for another plane to land, Flight 865 was cleared to taxi into position and hold. At 12:06:53 takeoff clearance was given. The DC-10 accelerated for takeoff. The nose was raised and at a speed of 158 kts the first officer called ""Rotate"". It was 12:07:40. Three seconds later, at a radio altitude of 9 feet, a fan blade of the 1st stage HP turbine from the no. 3 engine separated. The N1 dropped to 23,7% within a few seconds. At 12:07:45 the flight engineer called ""Engine failure number one."" Takeoff was aborted at about the V2 speed and the airplane contacted the runway one second later at a vertical acceleration force of 2.1 Gs. The thrust reversers were deployed and ground spoilers were extended. The DC-10 skidded off the runway through a ditch, fence and a road, before coming to a halt 620 m past the runway threshold.  Investigation revealed that the turbine blade that failed, had operated for 30913 hours and 6182 cycles. General Electric had advised customers to discard blades after about 6000 cycles.  The causes of the accident were as follows: ""Although the CAS was well in excess of V1 and the aircraft had already lifted off from the runway, the takeoff was aborted. Consequently the aircraft departed the end of the runway, came to rest and caught fire. It is estimated that contributing to the rejection of the takeoff under this circumstance was the fact that the CAP's judgement in the event of the engine failure was inadequate."""

	   France",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA),London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL),"Iberia Flight 504, a DC-9, departed Palma de Mallorca at 11:24 for a flight to London. At 12:19 the crew contacted Marina Control and reported at FL310, estimating at Nantes VOR at 12:52. At 12:36 the crew were told to contact Menhir Control and descend to FL290. At the same time a Spantax Convair CV-990, flight BX400 heading for London, was flying towards the Nantes VOR on the same altitude, but on a different airway. Because of this, the Convair crew were instructed arrive at the VOR at 13:00. Because the Convair was already quite close to the VOR the crew asked for confirmation of these instructions. At 12:40 the controller told them to 'Stand by' and replied two minutes later. Because the aircraft was at the ATC sector boundary the crew could barely hear the Marina controller who instructed them to contact Menhir control. The pilot erroneously thought he had to contact Menhir control when passing the Nantes VOR. In order to delay their arrival at the VOR the Spantax crew twice tried to request permission to carry out a 360-degree turn. When they did not get any answer from Marina, they initiated the turn without clearance. While in the midst of an overcast, the Convair collided with the DC-9. The CV-990 lost an outboard portion of its left wing and managed to carry out an emergency landing at Cognac-Châteaubernard Air Base (CNG). The DC-9 lost control and crashed. The air traffic control system had been taken over that day by military personnel because of a strike of the civilian controllers.  CONCLUSIONS: The Clement Marot Plan, the military contingency system to replace the civil air traffic services units in the event of a strike, by the very reason of its exceptional nature implied the use of rigorous planning traffic limitation per sector on the basis of control capacity and particularly strict compliance with the special regulations of the RAC-7 plan. The assignment of the same flight level by the control to the two aircraft IB 504 and BX 400, due to arrive at Nantes at the same time, created a source of conflict. The solution chosen by Menhir to resolve the conflict was based on separation in time. This solution, because of the reduction in normal separation, necessitated either particularly precise navigation by the crew of BX 400 or complete radar coverage and, in both cases, trouble-free communication facilities, conditions which were not realised. The continuing progress of the flight was affected by delays attributable in part to the control, in part to the crew and also to difficulty in air/ground radio communications resulting in complete failure of the crew and the control to understand one another. At the critical juncture, the crew, unmindful of their exact position, commenced a turn in order to lose time, without having been able to obtain the agreement of the control, as a result of which the aircraft interesected the adjacent route. The unidentified aircraft whose return appeared on the radar scope of one of the Menhir sub-sectors was' not identified by Menhir control as BX 400."

A request, and two subsequent requests, by the crew to climb to 9600 m were denied because of other traffic in the area. At 13:25, flight 7880 reported entering the sector at 5700 meters and requested to continue their climb to 9600 m. The controller initially cleared the flight to 7200 m and subsequently to 8400 m. Both flights were now at the same altitude, on crossing airways. The controller had calculated that the aircraft would be 3 minutes apart at that point. in fact, this was less than a minute. The supervisor of the Southwest sector noticed this and intervened. At 13:34 the supervisor instructed flight 7880 to climb to 9000 meters. A muffled response was heard by the supervisor, who assumed this was a read back from flight 7780.  At 13:35:38, while in the clouds at an altitude of 8400 meters, both aircraft collided at an angle of 95°. The cockpit of CCCP-65816 collided with the right wing of CCCP-65735. After the collision, both aircraft both aircraft entered a spin and started to break up. The debris fell to the ground in a large area near the villages of Kurilovka, Nikolaevka and Elizavetovka.  Conclusion: the cause of the catastrophe was errors and violations of the requirements of the NPP GA-78, made by the controller of the South-Western sector and the controller-instructor in terms of the appointment of flight levels and ensuring the established intervals between the aircraft, and compliance with the rules of radio exchange phraseology."

	   Comoros",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Sana'a International Airport (SAH/ODSN),Moroni-Prince Said Ibrahim In Airport (HAH/FMCH),"A Yemenia Airways Airbus A310-324 passenger plane was destroyed when it struck the water and crashed off shore from the Comoros. The airplane was on approach to Moroni-Prince Said Ibrahim In Airport (HAH) runway 20 following an international flight from San'a International Airport (SAH).  Yemenia Airways Flight IY626 had 142 passengers and 11 crew on board. A young girl survived the accident.   Approach  The flight conducted a night-time approach to runway 02, which was to be followed by a visual circle-to-land procedure and land on runway 20. The aircraft captured the localizer of runway 02 at 01:47 hours local time. At 01:49:41, the crew began the procedure turn to the left in order to reach the downwind leg. The aircraft was at an altitude of 1280 ft, descending. At about 800 ft, at 01:50:44, still in descent, the crew disengaged the autopilot, selected a heading of 014° (corresponding substantially to that of the downwind leg) and turned the aircraft to join the downwind leg.  During the turn, the vertical speed increased to -2,000 ft/min. At this point the rate should have been -500 ft/min. It is quite likely that, during the turn, the PF tried to see the runway, which until then he had not been able to see, and was therefore not looking at his instruments. This descent rate resulted in GPWS alarms. The crew responded to two SINK RATE alarms, then two PULL UP alarms, by increasing the aircraft's attitude and cancelling the bank. The aircraft regained altitude after reaching a lowest point at 350 ft radio altitude. The PF then resumed the right turn to align with the downwind leg. As in the previous turn, the aircraft was descending again and the vertical speed reached about -1000 ft/min, probably for the same reasons as before. The GPWS THREE HUNDRED and TOO LOW TERRAIN alarms sound. In response to these alarms, the PF increased the aircraft's attitude to 17° nose-up and cancelled the bank; the aircraft reached a new low point at 160 ft radio altitude. Except when the turn is established, it seems that, in this phase, the actions of the PF are consistent with the Flight Director indications both laterally and vertically. The crew appears not to have been aware that the vertical mode was unsuitable for their trajectory objective for the visual manoeuvre. The GPWS alarms made the crew aware of their low height. However, they did not apply the procedure following a GPWS PULL UP alarm that would have allowed them to recover significantly from the height and would have stopped the approach. As the aircraft climbed through 400 ft, the crew retracted the landing gear, announced that they would call back on the ""long final"" and then selected an altitude of 2,000 ft. The aircraft was then located near the 308° radial of the HAI VOR, indicating the end of the downwind leg defined on the approach chart. The retraction of the landing gear undoubtedly indicates that the crew is abandoning the approach. The GPWS alarms and the probable difficulty in seeing the runway likely led the crew to consider that the continuation of the approach was compromised in the short term. The crew's radio message indicating that they will call back on ""long final"" may constitute a ""mechanical"" readback from the PNF of the controller's last request, delayed due to GPWS alarms. The adjective ""long"", not used by the controller, would, however, indicate that the crew, or at least the PNF, is aware that they could turn onto finals now, but that they had not completely abandoned landing according to another strategy that may not yet be well defined or shared with the PF. The crew responded to the approach gear down alarm by cancelling the corresponding audible alarm and then engaged the LVL/CH mode (with the previously selected altitude of 2,000 ft), which increased engine thrust and changed the vertical mode of the Flight Director. The latter provided instructions to maintain a speed of 160 kt. Autopilot 1 was then engaged. Simultaneously, the crew ordered the flaps to be retracted to 0° and then selected a speed of 180 kt. These actions indicate that the crew wished to accelerate the aircraft and had abandoned the plan to turn to finals.   Aborted approach  The selected altitude was then changed to 0 feet, which was likely a handling error. The crew then retracted the slats to 0°, 14 knots below the usual speed and below the usual acceleration altitude. The crew probably did not perceive the aircraft's gradual descent in this phase of flight, with a thrust lever slowly moving back at 1°/s, nor the audible reduction in engine speed.  The very fast sequence of actions, the difficulty of performing the circle-to-land procedure at night without visual cues and in strong tailwind conditions, and the presence of alarms, probably generated stress and made it very difficult for the crew to understand all the states of the automatic flight system. Passing below 750 ft with landing gear retracted again activated of the audible GPWS alarm. The crew, who then became aware that the aircraft was at a low height and descending, reacted by disengaging the autopilot and applying a nose-up pitch. In this condition the alpha floor protection activated. Alpha floor is a low speed protection that applies Takeoff/Go Around (TOGA) thrust. The increase in thrust produced a nose-up effect that required appropriate nose-down action on the controls and trim. The crew did not react while the pitch increased to 27°. The stick shaker then activated to warn the crew of an impending stall. This led the crew to manually select TOGA 3 seconds later. The stall procedure also calls for a decrease in attitude, but the PF did not changed the attitude, probably for fear of descending the aircraft and striking the sea. It is also possible that he may not have been aware that the aircraft's attitude was excessive while his attention was focused on controlling the aircraft in roll. The aircraft remained in a stall situation until it impacted with the sea.  CAUSES: The accident was caused by inappropriate actions of the crew on the flight controls which brought the aircraft into a stall that could not be recovered. These actions were successive to an unstabilized visual maneuvering, during which many different alarms related to the proximity to the ground, the aircraft configuration and approach to stall sounded. The crew's attention was focused on the management of the path of the aircraft and the location of the runway, and they probably did not have enough mental resources available in this stressful situation, to respond adequately to different alarms.  Contributing to the accident: - The weather conditions at the airport (wind gusts around 30 kts). - Lack of training or pre-flight briefing of the crew in accordance with the Yemenia company operations manual, given the reluctance of the pilot to execute the MVI [Visual Manoeuvring with Prescribed track] (none of the documents submitted in the investigation shows this training). - The non-execution of the MVI maneuver by the crew (the plane left the LOC axis after the published point which is 5.2 NM), implying that the crew delayed the turn to reach the right hand downwind leg. - The non-application by the crew of the procedure following the PULL UP-alarm."

The take-off run was seen to be longer than usual and the aircraft crossed end of runway 32 at a height of about 6 meters. It struck trees, poles and the roofs of houses while rolling to the left and finally struck the ground inverted some 560 m beyond the runway. The aircraft impacted on a football pitch, bursting into flames.  Analysis of the accident was hampered by unserviceable flight recorders. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was not in operation at the time of the accident; when the cassette was opened the entire tape was found to be wound round the receiving reel. The three radio channels of the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) contained some information but the cockpit area microphone channel was inoperative and the recording did not contain useful information. The enquiry rules out structural and engine failure, flight control malfunction and systems failures as possible causes of the accident. The engine-pressure ratio (EPR) gauges showed 2.32, corresponding to the setting for a take-off with dry thrust.  On Boeing 707-100 aircraft equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT3C engines, de-mineralized water could be injected during takeoff to increase thrust. It was found that the water valves were open at the time of impact but it was not determined with certainty whether the crew attempted to perform a dry take-off but with reserve water, or whether the water was used with EPRs limited to 2.32 with the possibility of increasing the thrust when and as necessary.

The Cessna proceeded to Lindbergh Field, where two practice ILS approaches to runway 9 were flown. Although the reported wind was calm, runway 27 was the active runway at Lindbergh. About 08:57, N7711G ended a second approach and began a climbout to the northeast; at 08:59:01, the Lindbergh tower local controller cleared the Cessna pilot to maintain VFR conditions and to contact San Diego approach control. At 08:59:50, the Cessna pilot contacted San Diego approach control and stated that he was at 1,500 ft and ""northeastbound."" The approach controller told him that he was in radar contact and instructed him to maintain VFR conditions at or below 3,500 ft and to fly a heading of 070°. The Cessna pilot acknowledged and repeated the controller's instruction. Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Sacramento and San Diego, California, with an intermediate stop at Los Angeles, California. The flight departed Los Angeles at 08:34 on an IFR flight plan with 128 passengers and a crew of 7 on board. The first officer was flying the aircraft. A deadheading company pilot occupied the forward observer seat in the cockpit. At 08:53:19, Flight 182 reported to San Diego approach control at 11,000 ft and was cleared to descend to 7,000 ft. At 08:57, Flight 182 reported that it was leaving 9,500 ft for 7,000 ft and that the airport was in sight. The approach controller cleared the flight for a visual approach to runway 27; Flight 182 acknowledged and repeated the approach clearance. At 08:59:28, the approach controller advised Flight 182 that there was ""traffic (at) twelve o'clock, one mile, northbound."" Five seconds later the flight answered, ""We're looking."" At 08:59:39, the approach controller advised Flight 182, ""Additional traffic's twelve o'clock, three miles, just north of the field, northeastbound, a Cessna one seventy-two climbing VFR out of one thousand four hundred."" At 08:59:50, the copilot responded, ""Okay, we've got that other twelve.""  At 09:00:15, about 15 sec after instructing the Cessna pilot to maintain VFR at or below 3,500 ft and to fly 070°, the approach controller advised Flight 182 that ""traffic's at twelve o'clock, three miles, out of one thousand seven hundred."" At 09:00:21, the first officer said, ""Got em"", and 1 sec later the captain informed the controller, ""Traffic in sight."" At 09:00:23, the approach controller cleared Flight 182 to ""maintain visual separation,"" and to contact Lindbergh tower. At 09:00:28 Flight 182 answered, ""Okay,"" and 3 sec later the approach controller advised the Cessna pilot that there was ""traffic at six o'clock, two miles, eastbound; a PSA jet inbound to Lindbergh, out of three thousand two hundred, has you in sight. ""The Cessna pilot acknowledged, ""One one golf, roger."" At 09:00:34, Flight 182 reported to Lindbergh tower that they were on the downwind leg for landing. The tower acknowledged the transmission and informed Flight 182 that there was ""traffic, twelve o'clock, one mile, a Cessna."" At 09:00:41, the first officer called for 5° flaps, and the captain asked, ""Is that the one (we're) looking at?"" The first officer answered, ""Yeah, but I don't see him now."" At 09:00:44, Flight 182 told the local controller , ""Okay, we had it there a minute ago,"" and 6 sec later, ""I think he's pass(ed) off to our right."" The local controller testified that he heard, ""he's passing off to our right.""  The local controller acknowledged the transmission. Flight 182's flight crew continued to discuss the location of the traffic. At 09:00:52, the captain said, ""He was right over there a minute ago."" The first officer answered, ""Yeah.""  At 09:01:11, after the captain told the local controller how far they were going to extend their downwind leg, the first officer asked, ""Are we clear of that Cessna?"" The flight engineer said, ""Suppose to be""; the captain said, ""I guess""; and the forward jumpseat occupant said, ""I hope."" At 09:01:21, the captain said ""Oh yeah, before we turned downwind, I saw him about one o'clock, probably behind us now."" At 09:01:31, the first officer called, ""Gear down."" At 09:01:38, the first officer said , ""There's one underneath,"" and then, 1 sec. later, he said, ""I was looking at that inbound there."" At 09:01:28, the conflict alert warning began in the San Diego Approach Control Facility, indicating to the controllers that the predicted flightpaths of Flight 182 and the Cessna would enter the computer's prescribed warning parameters. At 09:01:47, the approach controller advised the Cessna pilot of ""traffic in your vicinity, a PSA jet has you in sight, he's descending for Lindbergh."" The transmission was not acknowledged. The approach controller did not inform Lindbergh tower of the conflict alert involving Flight 182 and the Cessna, because he believed Flight 182's flightcrew had the Cessna in sight. The aircraft collided at 09:01:47.  Flight 182 was descending and overtaking the Cessna, which was climbing in a wing level attitude. Just before impact, Flight 182 banked to the right slightly, and the Cessna pitched noseup and collided with the right wing of Flight 182. The Cessna broke up immediately and exploded. Segments of fragmented wreckage fell from the right wing and empennage of Flight 182. Flight 182 began a shallow right descending turn, leaving a trail of vaporlike substance from the right wing. A bright orange fire erupted in the vicinity of the right wing and increased in intensity as the aircraft descended. The aircraft remained in a right turn, and both the bank and pitch angles increased during the descent to about 50° at impact.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the flightcrew of Flight 182 to comply with the provisions of a maintain-visual-separation clearance, including the requirement to inform the controller when visual contact was lost; and the air traffic control procedures in effect which authorized the controllers to use visual separation procedures in a terminal area environment when the capability was available to provide either lateral or vertical separation to either aircraft. Contributing to the accident were (1) the failure of the controller to advise Flight 182 of the direction of movement of the Cessna; (2) the failure of the pilot of the Cessna to maintain his assigned heading; and (3) the improper resolution by the controller of the conflict alert."""

On board were 135, mostly French, holidaymakers who were heading home.  At 04:38 the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 22R for departure. After takeoff, at 04:42, the plane climbed and maneuvered for a procedural left turn to intercept the 306 radial from the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. When the autopilot was engaged the captain made an exclamation and the autopilot was immediately switched off again. The captain then requested Heading Select to be engaged. The plane then began to bank to the right. The copilot then warned the captain a few times about the fact that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right the captain stated ""OK come out"". The ailerons returned briefly to neutral before additional aileron movements commanded an increase in the right bank. The aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 5460 feet with a 50 degrees bank when the copilot stated: ""Overbank"". Repeating himself as the bank angle kept increasing. The maximum bank angle recorded was 111 degrees right. Pitch attitude at that time was 43 degrees nose down and altitude was 3470 feet. The observer on the flight deck, a trainee copilot, called ""Retard power, retard power, retard power"". Both throttles were moved to idle and the airplane gently seemed to recover from the nose-down, right bank attitude. Speed however increased, causing an overspeed warning. At 04:45 the airplane struck the surface of the water in a 24 degrees right bank, 24 degrees nose-down, at a speed of 416 kts and with a 3,9 G load. The wreckage sank to a depth of approx. 900 metres.  CONCLUSION: ""No conclusive evidence could be found from the findings gathered through this investigation to determin the probable cause. However, based on the work done, it could be concluded that any combination of these findings could have caused or contributed to the accident.  Although the crew at the last stage of this accident attempted to correctly recover, the gravity upset condition with regards to attitude, altitude and speed made this attempt insufficient to achieve a successful recovery."""

Taipei ATC then gave the flight radar vectors to turn left for a return to the airport. One minute and 45 seconds later the crew reported unable to turn left, so ATC gave permission to turn right. This was the last contact with the flight. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed into a hillside, right wing-first, at an altitude of 700 feet. It appeared that the no. 3 engine had separated from the wing. The engine struck the no. 4 engine, which separated also. The aircraft had accumulated 45868 hours, of which 74 hours since the last A-check maintenance on December 21, and 9094 cycles. Load factor of this flight was 90%.

At 16:44 Colombo Approach Control then cleared the flight down to 2000 feet and told them to expect a runway 04 approach. The crew were then to report overhead the KAT NDB or when the airfield was in sight. The crew continued their descent until the airplane crashed into the Anjimalai Mountain at an altitude of 4355 feet, about 40 nm East of Colombo.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Collision with rising terrain as the crew descended the aircraft below safe altitude owing to incorrect identification of their position vis-a-vis the airport.

During the weather briefing at Rotterdam Airport, 44 minutes before takeoff, the crew was told about the presence of an area with thunderstorms to the south and east of Rotterdam.  At 17:04 hours local time the F-28 took off from Rotterdam Airport. About five minutes after takeoff the crew noted heavy rainfall in thunderstorms on the weather avoidance radar and received clearance to avoid this area. Course was changed to the south in order to pass between two major thunderstorm cores. At 17:12 the aircraft entered a tornado, which resulted in loads on the airframe increasing to +6.8 G and -3,2 G. The right wing was bent upwards followed by a severe downward sweep. This compromised the structural integrity of the wing, causing a large portion of the outer wing to separate in an upward and rearward motion. Control was lost and the aircraft impacted a railway bridge inverted.  The investigation report did not contain a probable cause statement per ICAO Annex 13."

Aria Air Flight 1525 was 22 km out and flying at an altitude of 7000 feet when the air traffic controller requested the crew to reduce speed in order to maintain separation with a preceding flight. The captain decided to perform an orbit. After continuing the approach the navigator reported the distance to the runway. At 5 km out the navigator began reading the checklist without the captain's command. There were no verbal responses. Airspeed along the glide path was 325 km/h, which was 50 km/h more than the assigned speed for a landing weight of 93 tons. The rate of descent was 10 m/sec. The airplane crossed the runway threshold at a height of 31 m and a speed of 310 km/h.   At a height of 22 m the flight engineer shifted trust reversers to a reverse thrust position without a captain's command. He stowed the reversers again shortly before touchdown. The aircraft touched down on runway 21L at a speed of 275 km/h at a distance of 1000 m past the threshold, with about 2800 m remaining. The copilot then called for reverse, without monitoring the position of the reverse levers. The flight engineer, without checking the thrust reverse lever position and trust reversers position indication, set the throttles of engines 1 and 4 at the maximum trust.  The two inner engines, no. 2 and 3 were shut down by the flight engineer. Emergency braking was applied when the crew noted that the aircraft was not decelerating as expected. Braking however was ineffective. The aircraft ran off the end of the runway at a speed of 200 km/h, deviated to the right after the front right wheel tire blew out. Further on, it broke some approach lights with a concrete base and crossed the net barrier. The nose landing gear broke off and the aircraft traversed a ditch at a speed of 185 km/h. When the left main gear entered the ditch, the aircraft swung left and slammed into a wall. The nose of the aircraft collided with the concrete foundation of the 2,5 m high brick wall at a speed of 120 km/h. As a result of the impact the cockpit and forward fuselage up to the 6th seat row were destroyed. The crew and some passengers, who were in the first class cabin, were killed. The aircraft continued over the dirt for 160 m, broke a power line and came to a stop. There was no fire.  Main Cause : Considering those items in factual information and analysis, the main cause of this accident is ""weak Cockpit management between the crew"" to use correct landing techniques same as releasing Engine trust reversers Engine shut down in unsuitable time - ...  Contributive Factors: Some of contributive factors for this accident occurrence are noted as: - The copilot and the flight engineer had self activity& decision without the (PIC) coordination. - The cockpit crew was careless and not paying proper attention toward EGPWS warning. - Psychological adverse effect on cockpit crew because of presence of General Director of Aria airline"

	   United States of America",Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,"Denver-Stapleton International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN)","Portland International Airport, OR (PDX/KPDX)","United Airlines Flight 173, departed New York-JFK on a scheduled flight to Portland International Airport (PDX), with an en route stop at Denver (DEN). The DC-8-61 took off from Denver about 14:47. The planned time en route was 2 hrs 26 min. The planned arrival time at Portland was 17:13. There was 46,700 lb of fuel on board the aircraft when it departed the gate at Denver. This fuel included the Federal Aviation Regulation requirement for fuel to destination plus 45 min and the company contingency fuel of about 20 min.  At 17:05, Flight 173 called Portland Approach and advised that its altitude was 10,000 ft and its airspeed was being reduced. Portland responded and told the flight to maintain its heading for a visual approach to runway 28. Flight 173 acknowledged the approach instructions and stated, ""...we have the field in sight."" At 17:07, Portland Approach instructed the flight to descend and maintain 8,000 ft. Flight 173 acknowledged the instructions and advised that it was ""leaving ten."" At 17:09, Flight 173 received and acknowledged a clearance to continue its descent to 6,000 ft.  When the DC-8 was descending through about 8,000 ft, the first officer, who was flying the aircraft, requested the wing flaps be extended to 15 degrees, then asked that the landing gear be lowered. As the landing gear extended, an unusual sound was heard and the aircraft yawed. At 17:12, Portland Approach requested, ""United one seven three heavy, contact the tower, one one eight point seven."" The flight responded, ""negative, we'll stay with you. We'll stay at five. We'll maintain about a hundred and seventy knots. We got a gear problem. We'll let you know."" Portland Approach replied, ""United one seventy-three heavy roger, maintain five thousand. Turn left heading two zero zero."" The flight acknowledged the instructions. At 17:14, Portland Approach advised, ""United one seventy three heavy, turn left heading, one zero zero and I'll just orbit you out there 'til you get your problem."" Flight 173 acknowledged the instructions.  For the next 23 min, while Portland Approach was vectoring the aircraft in a holding pattern south and east of the airport, the flightcrew discussed and accomplished all of the emergency and precautionary actions available to them to assure themselves that all landing gear was locked in the full down position. The second officer checked the visual indicators on top of both wings, which extend above the wing surface when the landing gear is down-and-locked. About 17:38, Flight 173 contacted the United Airlines Systems Line Maintenance Control Center in San Francisco. The captain explained to company dispatch and maintenance personnel the landing gear problem and what the flightcrew had done to assure that the landing gear was fully extended. He said they were planning to land in about twenty minutes. About 17:44, the captain and the first flight attendant discussed passenger preparation, crash landing procedures, and evacuation procedures. At 17:46, the first officer asked the flight engineer, ""How much fuel we got...?"" The flight engineer responded, ""Five thousand."" About 17:50, the captain asked the flight engineer to ""Give us a current card on weight. Figure about another fifteen minutes."" The first officer responded, ""Fifteen minutes?"" To which the captain replied, ""Yeah, give us three or four thousand pounds on top of zero fuel weight."" The flight engineer then said, ""Not enough. Fifteen minutes is gonna really run us low on fuel here."" Some calculations were made and at 17:52 the flight engineer talked to Portland and discussed the aircraft's fuel state, the number of persons on board the aircraft, and the emergency landing precautions at the airport.  A fuel check at 17:57 learned that there were 1,000 lb in each tank, totalling 4,000 lb of fuel. From 17:57 until 18:00, the captain and the first officer engaged in a conversation which included discussions of giving the flight attendants ample time to prepare for the emergency, cockpit procedures in the event of an evacuation after landing, whether the brakes would have antiskid protection after landing, and the procedures the captain would be using during the approach and landing. At 18:01, the flight engineer reported that the cabin would be ready in ""another two or three minutes."" At 18:02, the flight engineer advised, ""We got about three on the fuel and that's it."" The aircraft was then about 5 nmi south of the airport on a southwest heading. Portland Approach then asked Flight 173 for a status report. The first officer replied, ""Yeah, we have indication our gear is abnormal. It'll be our intention, in about five minutes, to land on two eight left. We would like the equipment standing by. Our indications are the gear is down and locked. We've got our people prepared for an evacuation in the event that should become necessary."" At 18:03 Portland Approach asked that Flight 173 advise them when the approach would begin. The captain responded, ""...They've about finished in the cabin. I'd guess about another three, four, five minutes."" At this time the aircraft was about 8 nmi south of the airport on a southwesterly heading. At 18:06, the first flight attendant entered the cockpit and reported that they were ready in the passenger cabin. At this time the aircraft was about 17 nmi south of the airport on a southwesterly heading. The captain then said, ""Okay. We're going to go in now. We should be landing in about five minutes."" Almost simultaneous with this comment, the first officer said, ""I think you just lost number four ..."" followed immediately by advice to the flight engineer, ""... better get some crossfeeds open there or something."" At 18:06:46, the first officer told the captain, ""We're going to lose an engine..."" At 18:06:49, the first officer again stated, ""We're losing an engine."" Again the captain asked, ""Why?"" The first officer responded, ""Fuel."" The captain replied, ""Why?"" Between 18:06:52 and 18:07:06, the CVR revealed conflicting and confusing conversation between flight crewmembers as to the aircraft's fuel state. At 18:07:06, the first officer said, ""It's flamed out."" At 18:07:12, the captain called Portland Approach and requested, ""...would like clearance for an approach into two eight left, now."" The aircraft was about 19 nmi south southwest of the airport and turning left. This was the first request for an approach clearance from Flight 173 since the landing gear problem began. Portland Approach immediately gave the flight vectors for a visual approach to runway 28L. The flight turned toward the vector heading of 010 degrees.  At 18:09:21, the captain advised Portland Approach, ""United, seven three is going to turn toward the airport and come on in."" After confirming Flight 173's intentions, Portland Approach cleared the flight for the visual approach to runway 28L. At 18:10:17, the captain requested that the flight engineer ""reset that circuit breaker momentarily. See if we get gear lights."" The flight engineer complied with the request. At 18:10:47, the captain requested the flight's distance from the airport. Portland approach responded, ""I'd call it eighteen flying miles."" At 18:12:42, the captain made another request for distance. Portland Approach responded, ""Twelve flying miles."" The flight was then cleared to contact Portland tower. At 18:13:21, the flight engineer stated, ""We've lost two engines, guys."" At 18:13:25, he stated, ""We just lost two engines - one and two."" At 1813:38, the captain said, They're all going. We can't make Troutdale."" The first officer said, ""We can't make anything."" At 18:13:46, the captain told the first officer, ""Okay. Declare a mayday."" At 18:13:50, the first officer called Portland International Airport tower and declared, ""Portland tower, United one seventy three heavy, Mayday. We're--the engines are flaming out. We're going down. We're not going to be able to make the airport."" This was the last radio transmission from Flight 173. About 18:15, the aircraft crashed into a wooded section of a populated area of suburban Portland about 6 nmi east southeast of the airport. There was no fire. The wreckage path was about 1,554 ft long and about 130 ft wide.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the captain to monitor properly the aircraft's fuel state and to properly respond to the low fuel state and the crewmember's advisories regarding fuel state. This resulted in fuel exhaustion to all engines. His inattention resulted from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction and preparations for a possible landing emergency.  Contributing to the accident was the failure of the other two flight crewmembers either to fully comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to successfully communicate their concern to the captain."""

This caused the flight to be poorly positioned for approach. The aircraft passed the Outer Marker at a speed of 385 km/h (80 km/h too fast) and was 60 m above the glide slope. The flight director was inadvertently used in the 'go-around-mode', which led to abnormal instrument indications. This caused some confusion. The first officer, who was flying the approach became preoccupied with the problem. The DC-9 continued to descend and struck a seawall 3000 feet short of and 150 feet to the right of runway 04R, crashed and caught fire. RVR at the time was 500 m with 60 m overcast. All occupants, except one passenger, were killed in the crash. The lone survivor, who had been injured critically, died on December 11, 1973.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the flight crew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized precision approach conducted in rapidly changing meteorological conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flight crew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services."""

The aircraft was destroyed and the six crewmembers and 32 passengers on board were all fatally injured. The aircraft, N7434U, performed a scheduled service from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It had been operating since January 15, 1969, with the no. 3 generator inoperative. This was allowed because according to the Minimum Equipment List, the aircraft is airworthy with only two generators operable provided certain procedures are followed and electrical loads are monitored during flight. Flight 266 was scheduled to depart the gate at 17:55, but was delayed until 18:07 because of the inclement weather and loading problems. The flight commenced its takeoff roll on runway 24 at approximately 18:17. At 18:18:30 the sound of an engine fire warning bell was heard in the cockpit. The crew reported a no. 1 engine fire warning and stated that they wanted to return to the airport. Shortly after shutdown of the no. 1 engine, electrical power from the remaining generator (no. 2) was lost. Following loss of all generator power, the standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the no. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. The Boeing descended until it struck the sea. The ocean depth at this point was approximately 950 feet.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power.

Weather conditions at Madeira were poor. It was raining and a 6/8 cumulus overcast at 1500 feet with a visibility of 3000 m made for a challenging approach.  The first NDB approach to runway 24 was discontinued at the 'MAD' NDB because the crew hadn't established visual contact with the runway. Heavy rainshowers were reported, but the flight crew reported seeing the runway lights when over the 'MAD' NDB for the second time. The aircraft touched down 2000 feet past the threshold with just 3000 feet runway length remaining. Thrust reversers were deployed and spoilers extended, but the 727 aquaplaned slightly and could not be stopped on the runway. The Boeing overran and plunged over a steep bank. It struck a stone bridge, shearing off the right wing. It then crashed almost vertically on to a beach about 130 feet below the level of the airport, bursting in flames.  CAUSA PROVÁVEL: ""A Comissão de Inquérito determinou como causa provável do acidente a impossibilidade de desacelerar a aeronave até à paragem no comprimento da pista, devido, provavelmente, aos seguintes factores: - Condições meteorológicas muito desfavoráveis no momento da aterragem; - Existência possível de condições para hidroplanagem; - Velocidade de aterragem de Vref + 19 nós; - Aterragem comprida motivada por um longo ""flare""; - Correcção direccional brusca após o toque na pista.""

The flight received clearance to climb to FL350 and to head directly to Palembang. At 15:47 the aircraft passed FL245. Ten seconds later, the crew requested permission to proceed directly to PARDI. The air traffic controller instructed MI185 to standby, to continue flying directly to Palembang and to report when reaching FL350. At 15:53, MI 185 reported reaching FL350. Subsequently, the controller cleared MI185 to proceed directly to PARDI and to report when abeam Palembang. At 16:05, the cockpit voice recorder ceased recording. At 16:10 the controller informed MI185 that it was abeam Palembang. The controller instructed the aircraft to maintain FL350 and to contact Singapore Control when at PARDI. The crew acknowledged this call. At 16:11:27 the FDR ceased recording. MI 185 was still at FL350 until it started a rapid descent around 16:12:18. The aircraft broke up in flight and crashed into the Musi river delta. Although not concluded by the Indonesian authorities, it has been suggested by a.o. the US NTSB that the captain may have committed suicide by switching off both flight recorders and intentionally putting the Boeing 737 in a dive, possibly when the first officer had left the flight deck. During 1997 the captain experienced multiple work-related difficulties, particularly during the last 6 months. Also at the time of the accident the captain was experiencing significant financial difficulties, which was disputed by the Indonesian investigators. Coincidentally the accident happened on exactly the same date in 1979 the captain was forced to withdraw from a scheduled Air Force A-4 Skyhawk jet training mission because of a mechanical problem with his aircraft. The other three aircraft continued with the training mission and collided with terrain after encountering bad weather in a mountainous area. All of the pilots on board the aircraft were killed.  FINAL REMARKS:  - The NTSC investigation into the MI 185 accident was a very extensive, exhaustive and complex investigation to find out what happened, how it happened, and why it happened. It was an extremely difficult investigation due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft resulting in highly fragmented wreckage, the difficulties presented by the accident site and the lack of information from the flight recorders during the final moments of the accident sequence. -  The NTSC accident investigation team members and participating organizations have done the investigation in a thorough manner and to the best of their conscience, knowledge and professional expertise, taking into consideration all available data and information recovered and gathered during the investigation. -  Given the limited data and information from the wreckage and flight recorders, the NTSC is unable to find the reasons for the departure of the aircraft from its cruising level of FL350 and the reasons for the stoppage of the flight recorders. -  The NTSC has to conclude that the technical investigation has yielded no evidence to explain the cause of the accident.  The US NTSB responded to the Indonesian investigation report in a letter dated December 11, 2000. The NTSB states that ""when all of the investigative evidence is considered, it leads to the conclusions that: 1) no airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures caused or contributed to the accident, and 2) the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action. Specifically, a) the accident airplanes flight profile is consistent with sustained manual nose-down flight control inputs; b) the evidence suggests that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was intentionally disconnected; c) recovery of the airplane was possible but not attempted; and d) it is more likely that the nose-down flight control inputs were made by the captain than by the first officer."""

Gear was selected up, flaps retracted, but also power was retarded. The aircraft crossed the end of the runway and went very low over about 1800 m of flat hard soil, then impacted on a road which was about .8 m above the flat terrain with gulleys on either side of about 0.7 m deep. After several further impacts, it came to rest in a riverbed about 220 m from the road, about 1.5 m below the flat terrain.  The aircraft came to rest in several parts. The front fuselage had separated from the centre fuselage near the wing front spar and came to rest inverted, about 50 m from the aft fuselage. The lower fuselage of this section was damaged and crushed from the radome rearwards with progressively more damage further aft, towards the break. However, survival space in this section was basically not compromised. Most seats were still fully attached to the floor with only some fracture at/near the floor break.  The centre wing section, still connected to the right hand wing was badly damaged. The left hand wing had separated. The fuselage skin and top skin were torn from the centre section. A large number of broken seats and interior parts were found in an area aside the centre wing, presumably ejected from the centre wing/fuselage area upon impact with the sand in the river bed. Most of the fatalities were found here.  Structural integrity of the aft fuselage, which had separated from the centre wing section, was entirely lost. Although still grouped together, both engines had separated from the tail, and the fin showed unusually severe damage.  The occupants of the inverted forward section either evacuated on their own through the open end at the rear or with the assistance of others.

Refueling stops were planned at Bombay, Dubai, and Ankara.  After a one-hour stopover at Bombay, the flight took off for Dubai at 15:20 hours UTC. An IFR flight plan was submitted for airway R19, containing five reporting points. The en route altitude was FL310 and all reporting points were passed ahead of schedule. At 17:25 the crew received the current Dubai weather information which showed a wind from 040 degrees at 8 knots; 10 km visibility; and 5/8 clouds at 2000 feet. At 17:42 the flight contacted Dubai Approach and reported on the 084 radial of the Dubai (DO) VOR. The approach controller told the crew to expect descent clearance at 17:55. However, at 17:49, the crew radioed approach control, requesting an immediate descent as they were 95 NM out. Unknown to the crew, their actual position was 162 NM from Dubai. The controller cleared the flight down to 4000 feet and reported that runway 30 and 12 were both available. The flight replied: ""We will see if we can make this a straight in on 30"". At 17:56 hours the flight reported descending through FL135. The controller replied: ""Recleared 'DO' 2000 feet on Dubai 1016 mb report 2000 feet or field in sight"". In conditions of darkness the flight crew likely spotted the city lights of Fujayrah, Ghurayfah and Kalba during the descent, assuming these were the lights of Dubai. Radio contact between the flight and Dubai Approach became more difficult during the descent over mountainous terrain. As a result of flying over mountainous terrain, about 80 km to the east of Dubai, flight 296 also had difficulty in tuning into the NDB and VOR frequencies. Descent was continued until the plane struck a mountain ridge at 1600 feet.  The reason for the accident was that the aircraft was flown below the prescribed minimum altitude, probably because: 1. The pilots thought that they were closer to their destination than they actually were, supposedly due to the incorrect information on the outdated flight plan in use or due to a misreading of the weather radar, or a combination of both. 2.

The aircraft departed Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, at 23:21 hours local time on May 18. Scheduled departure time was 22:45 hours. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt. Last contact with the flight was at FL370, about 02:29 hours. According to Greek military authorities their primary radar showed the aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degrees turn in the opposite direction as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016.   The Egyptian authorities found that: - The flight recorders stopped operating while the aircraft was in cruise at an altitude of 37,000 feet; - The aircraft systems sent ACARS messages indicating the presence of smoke in toilets and the avionics bay; - The data from the data recorder confirms these messages; - The playback of the cockpit voice recorder reveals, in particular, that the crew mentioned the existence of a fire on board; - Several pieces of debris were retrieved from the accident site. Some of these had signs of having been subject to high temperatures, and traces of soot.  On December 15, 2016, investigators reported that traces of explosives were found on several victims. Egyptian authorities determined that there had been a malicious act. The formal investigation per ICAO Annex 13 was stopped and further investigation fell within the sole jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.  Contradicting the Egyptian finding, the French BEA considered that the most likely hypothesis was that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aircraft was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft.  In April 2022, Italian newpaper Corriere della Sera published an article based on the French judicial investigation report. This document supposedly concluded that the accident was caused by an uncontrollable cockpit fire that broke out due to a leak from the FO's oxygen tank which had been replaced a few days before and the pilot(s) smoking in the cockpit."

On August 22, 1981, the aircraft took off from Taipei on a flight to Makung (MZG). Ten minutes after takeoff from there was a loss of cabin pressure. The flight crew returned to Taipei, where repair work was carried out. Later that day the aircraft entered service again as Flight 103 to Kaohsiung. Fourteen minutes after takeoff the aircraft suffered an explosive decompression and disintegrated in flight.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Extensive corrosion damage in the lower fuselage structures, and at a number of locations there were corrosion penetrated through pits, holes and cracks due to intergranular corrosion and skin thinning exfoliation corrosion, and in addition, the possible existence of undetected cracks because of the great number of pressurization cycles of the aircraft (a total of 33,313 landings), interaction of these defects and the damage had so deteriorated that rapid fracture occurred at a certain flight altitude and pressure differential resulting rapid decompression and sudden break of passenger compartment floor beams and connecting frames, cutting control cables and electrical wiring.

Swissair flight SR316 originated at Genève-Cointrin Airport (GVA), Switzerland and was bound for Bombay, India Beijing, China. Athens was the first intermediate stop. During an ILS approach to runway 33R at Athens Airport, the crew got visual contact with the airport and was cleared to land on runway 15L. The approach was made at a speed of 146 knots and the aircraft touched down about 740 m beyond the displaced threshold and about 2240 m before the runway end. The DC-8 decelerated but overran the end of the runway. The left wing and tail separated before the aircraft came to rest on a public road some 80 m beyond the end of the runway and 4 m below airport elevation. A fire broke out on the right side and spread quickly. All 14 victims died due to smoke or fire and were all seated at rows 21-26.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""(1) The crew touched down the aircraft too late, at a speed higher than normal after a non-stabilized final approach. (2) The crew did not fully apply the braking systems (wheel brakes and reverse thrust) particularly the wheel brakes after a touchdown under known adverse conditions, so that it was not possible to stop the aircraft at least before the end of the overrun area."" Note: the member of the Operations team of the Accident Investigation Committee had a different opinion from the rest of the Committee regarding the cause of the accident. That is:  ""After a non-stabilized approach a too-late touchdown at an increased speed was not realized by the crew. Contributing was the fact that (1) the company's recommended technique concerning 'landing when braking action is less then good' was not followed by the crew. (2) Wheel brake application was not fully utilized by the crew at the proper stage of rolling after touchdown. (3) Reverse thrust application was not fully utilized by the crew at the proper stage of rolling after touchdown. """

	   United States of America",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,"Charleston Municipal Airport, SC (CHS/KCHS)","Charlotte-Douglas Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT)","Eastern Air Lines Flight 212, a Douglas DC-9-31, N8984E, operated as a scheduled passenger flight from Charleston, South Carolina, to Chicago, Illinois, with an en route stop at Charlotte, North Carolina. The flight departed Charleston at 07:00 hours local time with 78 passengers and 4 crew members on board. The first officer was Pilot Flying. During the descent into Charlotte, until about 2 minutes and 30 seconds prior to the accident, the flightcrew engaged in conversations not pertinent to the operation of the aircraft. These conversations covered a number of subjects, from politics to used cars, and both crewmembers expressed strong views and mild aggravation concerning the subjects discussed.  At 07:32:13, as the flight intercepted the inbound VOR radial for the approach, the flightcrew commenced a discussion of Carowinds Tower, which was located ahead and to the left of the projected flightpath. This discussion lasted 35 seconds, during which 12 remarks were made concerning the subject. A considerable degree of the flightcrew's attention was directed outside the cockpit during that time. During this period, the aircraft descended through 1,800 feet (1,074 feet above touchdown elevation), the altitude which should have been maintained until it crossed Ross Intersection, the final approach fix (FAF). At the end of the 35-second period, the aircraft was still 1.5 nm short of the FAF. At 07:32:41, during the latter part of the discussion regarding Carowinds Tower, the terrain warning alert sounded in the cockpit, signifying that the aircraft was 1,000 feet above the ground. Within seconds after the discussion of Carowinds Tower terminated at 07:32:48, the rate of descent of the aircraft was slowed from about 1,500 feet per minute to less than 300 feet per minute.  At 07:33:24, the aircraft passed over Ross Intersection (the FAF) at an altitude of 1,350 feet (624 feet above field elevation), which is 450 feet below the prescribed crossing altitude. The captain did not make the required callout at the FAF, which should have included the altitude (above field elevation) and deviation from the Vref speed. Although shortly before crossing the FAF, one of the pilots stated ""three ninety four,"" a reference to the MDA in height above field elevation. While in the vicinity of Ross Intersection, the first officer asked for 50 degrees of flaps; this request was carried out by the captain. The airspeed at this time was 168 knots, as contrasted with the recommended procedure which calls for the airspeed when passing over the FAF to be in the area of Vref, which in this instance was 122 knots.  At 07:33:36, the captain advised Charlotte Tower that they were by Ross Intersection. The local controller cleared the flight to land on runway 36. The last radio transmission from the flight was the acknowledgement, ""Alright,"" at 07:33:46. Shortly after passing Ross Intersection, the aircraft passed through an altitude of 500 feet above field elevation, which should have prompted the captain to call out altitude, deviation from Vref speed, and rate of descent. No such callout was made, nor was the required callout made when the plane descended through an altitude 100 feet above the MDA of 394 feet above the field elevation. The descent rate, after passing Ross, increased to 800 feet per minute, where it stabilized until approximately 7 to 8 seconds prior to impact, when it steepened considerably. According to the CVR, at 0733:52, the captain said, ""Yeah, we're all ready,"" followed shortly thereafter by ""All we got to do is find the airport"". At 07:33:57, the first officer answered ""Yeah"". About one-half second later both pilots shouted. The aircraft struck some small trees and then impacted a cornfield about 100 feet below the airport elevation of 748 feet. The aircraft struck larger trees, broke up, and burst into flames. It was destroyed by the impact and ensuing fire.  The aircraft crashed about 1.75 statute miles from Ross Intersection and about 3.3 statute miles short of the threshold of runway 36. Eleven passengers and two crewmembers survived the crash and fire. One passenger died 3 days after the crash, one after 6 days and another passenger died 29 days after the accident.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline in that the crew did not follow prescribed procedure."""

The before takeoff checklist was not fully accomplished. The crew did not realise that the stabilizer was set at -6° instead of the calculated position of -3,6°. During takeoff from runway 30 the airplane rotated rapidly and became airborne prior to attaining takeoff speed. At an altitude of 100-120 m at a speed of 210-220 km/h, 20 km/h below the speed mentioned in the Flight Manual, the crew retracted the flaps, while simultaneously lowering the pitch angle for acceleration speed.  Takeoff was performed on a moonless night, with a lack of visual cues in the direction of takeoff. The crew did not notice that the airplane was dangerously close to the ground, also because the altimeter had been set to the incorrect pressure. The altimeter showed an altitude 100 m higher than the actual altitude. The airplane struck trees, crashed into the forest, and burst into flames."

The airplane was due to be returned to its owner, Air New Zealand, on December 1, 2008. The Airbus was ferried to Perpignan Airport, France, where it underwent maintenance at EAS Industries. It was also repainted in full Air New Zealand livery, but retained the registration D-AXLA.  The leasing agreement specified a programme of in-flight checks to ensure the airplane was fit for purpose.  The crew was made up of a captain and a co-pilot from XL Airways Germany. A pilot and three engineers from Air New Zealand, as well as a representative of the New Zealand Civil Aviation authority were also on board. The pilot and one of the engineers had taken seats in the cockpit. The takeoff took place at 15:44 hours local time. A few minutes after takeoff, the crew requested to perform a ""360"", but this not authorised by the controller. The en route controller explained to the crew that they could not undertake tests in general air traffic and that the flight plan filed was not compatible with the manoeuvres requested. The crew announced that they wanted to continue on the route planned in the flight plan and asked to climb to FL310 before turning back towards Perpignan. At around 16:12, the crew turned back. Some checks planned in the flight programme were performed. The maximum flight level reached was FL390. At 16:33, in descent towards the FL130, the crew contacted Perpignan Approach. They were then cleared to descend to FL120 towards the PPG VOR. The approach controller asked them to reduce speed to 250 kt and to plan a hold at the PPG VOR. They were number two on approach. At 16:34, the crew requested radar vectoring. The approach controller asked the crew to turn left onto heading 090 and to reduce the speed to 200 kt. The approach controller asked the crew to reduce speed to 180 kt and to descend to FL 80 then to FL 60. From 16:38:03 and for about forty seconds, the pilot from Air New Zealand described the actions to take to perform a check at low speed planned in the programme. At around 16:40, the approach controller asked the crew to turn right on heading 190 and to maintain 180 kt. The airplane speed was 215 kt. About one minute later, the approach controller cleared the crew to the LANET ILS approach for runway 33 and to descend towards 5,000 ft altitude. At the request of the crew, the approach controller repeated the message. While the co-pilot was reading back, the captain indicated to the Air New Zealand pilot that the low speed flight should be made later, during the flight towards Frankfurt. He even considered not performing it. At 16:42:14, the approach controller asked for the speed of the airplane. The co-pilot answered that the speed was falling then at 16:42:25 that it was 180 kt. The approach controller then asked them to maintain 180 kt and to descend to 2,000 ft. The slat and flap controls selector was put in position 2. At 16:42:46, the captain stated that the approach was not included in the database. Thirty-six seconds later, the co-pilot carried out the approach briefing. At 16:43:37, the captain announced that he was passing under the cloud layer. He disengaged the autopilot and asked the Air New Zealand pilot what he wanted. The latter answered that it was necessary to go slowly and described to him the necessary actions to activate the alpha floor protection. During these exchanges, the captain called for gear extension and put the thrust levers in the IDLE position. At the same time, the approach controller asked the crew its intentions twice. The co-pilot answered that they wanted to make a go-around and continue towards Frankfurt. At 16:44:30, the captain stabilised the airplane at an altitude of 3,000 ft. The airplane was in FULL configuration. In thirty-five seconds, the speed went from 136 to 99 kt and the horizontal stabilizer went to the pitch-up stop. The stall warning sounded. The pitch angle was then slightly below 19 degrees. The thrust levers were advanced towards the TO/GA position in the following second. While the thrust on the engines increased in a symmetrical manner, the speed continued to drop to 92.5 kt, then began to increase. The airplane started to roll slightly to the left, then to the right. The captain countered these movements. At 16:45:15, the flight control laws changed to ""direct"" law. The bank angle was 50 degrees to the right. At 16:45:19, the stall warning stopped. The bank angle was 40 degrees to the left. One second later, the pitch angle was 7 degrees, the wings were close to horizontal and the speed was 138 kt. The airplanes pitch and altitude then began to increase. During this climb, the stall warning sounded a second time. The crew retracted the landing gear and the flight control law in pitch changed to ""alternate"". At 16:45:44 the maximum recorded values were: pitch 57 degrees, altitude 3,800 ft. The speed was below 40 kt. At 16:45:47 the stall warning stopped. It sounded again five seconds later. From 16:45:55, the airplane banked to the right up to 97 degrees and its pitch reached 42 degrees nose-down. At 16:45:58, the stall warning stopped. The slat and flap controls selector was placed in position 1, then 0 two seconds later. The captain used the flight controls and the thrust levers to try to recover the airplane. At 16:46:00, the stall warning stopped. At 16:46:06.8, the last recorded values were a pitch of 14° nose down, a bank angle of 15° to the right, a speed of 263 kt and an altitude of 340 ft. Less than a second later, the airplane crashed into the sea.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The loss of control of the aeroplane by the crew following the improvised demonstration of the functioning of the angle of attack protections, while the blockage of the angle of attack sensors made it impossible for these protections to trigger. The crew was not aware of the blockage of the angle of attack sensors. They did not take into account the speeds mentioned in the programme of checks available to them and consequently did not stop the demonstration before the stall. The following factors contributed to the accident:     * The decision to carry out the demonstration at a low height;     * The crews management, during the thrust increase, of the strong increase in the longitudinal pitch, the crew not having identified the pitch-up stop position of the horizontal stabiliser nor acted on the trim wheel to correct it, nor reduced engine thrust;     * The crew having to manage the conduct of the flight, follow the programme of in-flight checks, adapted during the flight, and the preparation of the following stage, which greatly increased the work load and led the crew to improvise according to the constraints encountered;     * The decision to use a flight programme developed for crews trained for test flights, which led the crew to undertake checks without knowing their aim;     * The absence of a regulatory framework in relation to non-revenue flights in the areas of air traffic management, of operations and of operational aspects;     * The absence of consistency in the rinsing task in the aeroplane cleaning procedure, and in particular the absence of protection of the AOA sensors, during rinsing with water of the aeroplane three days before the flight. This led to the blockage of the AOA sensors through freezing of the water that was able to penetrate inside the sensor bodies.  The following factors also probably contributed to the accident:     * Inadequate coordination between an atypical team composed of three airline pilots in the cockpit;     * The fatigue that may have reduced the crews awareness of the various items of information relating to the state of the systems."

	   U.S. Virgin Islands",Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,"New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)",Saint Thomas-Harry S.Truman Airport (STT/TIST),"American Airlines Flight 625 was a scheduled flight from Providence Airport (PVD) to St.Thomas (STT) on the U.S Virgin Islands with an intermediate stop in New York (JFK). The Boeing 727 departed New York at 12:00 AST. On approach to St. Thomas, at 15:04, the flight crew cancelled their IFR flight plan and proceeded VFR. The captain elected to use the runway 09 ILS for vertical guidance. The glide slope was intercepted at 1500 feet msl (flaps 15deg and at a 160 KIAS airspeed). The flaps were lowered to 25 and later to 30 degrees. The company prescribed 40 degrees was never selected. The speed was still 10 KIAS above Vref when the aircraft passed the threshold at an estimated altitude of 30-40 feet. At 1000 feet down the runway, while initiating the flare, turbulence caused the right wing to drop. The wings were leveled and the aircraft floated a while until touchdown 2200-2300 feet down the runway. The captain decided that the aircraft couldn't be stopped on the remaining runway. He immediately initiated a go-around. Because of the absence of any sensation either of power being applied or of aircraft acceleration, the throttles were closed again. The aircraft, in a 11 degree nose up attitude, ran off the runway and struck a localizer antenna. The right wingtip clipped a hillside just south of the antenna and the aircraft continued, hit an embankment, became airborne and contacted the ground on the opposite side of the perimeter road. The aircraft continued and came to rest 83 feet past the perimeter road, bursting into flames.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's actions and his judgment in initiating a go-around maneuver with insufficient runway remaining after a long touchdown. The long touchdown is attributed to a deviation from prescribed landing techniques and an encounter with an adverse wind condition, common at the airport. The non-availability of information about the aircraft's go-around performance capabilities may have been a factor in the captain's abortive attempt to go-around a long landing."""

The first leg of the flight was uneventful. As the flight approached Fortaleza, the crew were cleared to descend from their cruising altitude of FL330 to FL50 (5000 feet). In night-time conditions with the bright lights of the city in front, the captain descended below 5000 feet. Despite two altitude alert system warnings and the co-pilot's warning of the mountains ahead, the captain continued to descend below the minimum descend altitude. The Boeing then struck a wooded mountainside at 1950 feet.  Human Factor: It contributed to the extent that during the descent the Commander concentrated his attention on the illuminated city, disconnecting himself from other sensory impulses, such as observation of distance and altitude. Material Factor: Did not contribute. Operational Factor: Contributed for the reasons below: - Poor planning for the descent. - Non-observance of air traffic rules (non-compliance with control instructions, non-observance of the minimum safety altitude and non-maintenance of the speed foreseen for terminal flight below 10,000 feet). Therefore, serious flight indiscipline. - lack of cabin discipline. - Non-compliance with company operating standards."

Thursday 14 October 2004,03:56,Boeing 747-244B (SF),MK Airlines,80619,7,"Halifax International Airport, NS (YHZ) - 
	   Canada",Take off,Cargo,"Halifax International Airport, NS (YHZ/CYHZ)",Zaragoza Airport (ZAZ/LEZG),"At 00:03 local time MK Airlines flight 1602 departed Windsor Locks-Bradley International Airport (BDL) for a flight to Zaragoza, Spain with a cargo of lawn tractors. An intermediate stop was made at Halifax (YHZ), where the aircraft landed at 02:12 local time. At YHZ the aircraft was loaded with 53,000 kilograms of lobster and fish. After fueling, the total fuel load was 89 400 kg. The planned takeoff weight was 353 000 kg. The Boeing Laptop Tool (BLT) was then used to calculate the takeoff speeds. Since the software was last used before the takeoff from Bradley, it still contained those figures. The airport information and weather was changed to Halifax, but somehow the takeoff weight was not changed and remained showing 240.000 kg. Takeoff performance data were generated, resulting in incorrect V speeds and thrust setting being transcribed to the takeoff data card. It is most likely that the crew did not adhere to the operator's procedures for an independent check of the takeoff data card, so the erroneous figures went unnoticed. It was dark, but the weather was fine as the airplane was cleared to taxi to runway 24 (8800 ft / 2682 m long) for departure. After push back, the aircraft began to taxi, the flaps were extended to 20°, and the horizontal stabilizer was set to 6.1 trim units, where it remained for the duration of the flight. The flight control checks were completed during the taxi. The aircraft entered runway 24 at Taxiway Delta and backtracked to the threshold. The aircraft then made a 180° turn to the right and, upon lining up with the runway, the thrust levers were advanced and a rolling takeoff was commenced at 06:53:22. At the start of the takeoff roll, the thrust levers were smoothly advanced from ground idle thrust (approximately 1.0 EPR) to takeoff power with all final EPR settings indicating between 1.3 and 1.33. The aircraft accelerated through 80 KCAS (06:53:46) approximately 1800 feet (550 m) from the threshold. At 130 KCAS, the control column was moved aft to 8.4° to initiate rotation as the aircraft passed the 5500-foot (1680 m) mark of runway 24 (3300 feet / 1010 m of runway remaining). The aircraft began to rotate. The pitch attitude stabilized briefly at approximately 9° nose-up, with airspeed at 144 KCAS. Because the 747 still had not lifted off the runway, the control column was moved further aft to 10°, and the aircraft responded with a further pitch up to approximately 11°; initial contact of the lower aft fuselage with the runway occurred at this time. The aircraft was approximately at the 8000-foot (2450 m) mark and slightly left of the centreline. The control column was then relaxed slightly, to 9° aft.  The pitch attitude stabilized in the 11° range for the next four seconds, and the lower aft fuselage contact with the runway ended briefly. With approximately 600 feet (185 m) of runway remaining, the thrust levers were advanced to 92 per cent and the EPRs increased to 1.60. With 420 feet (130 m) remaining, the lower aft fuselage contacted the runway a second time. As the aircraft passed the end of the runway, the control column was 13.5° aft, pitch attitude was 11.9° nose-up, and airspeed was 152 KCAS. The highest recorded nose-up pitch of 14.5° (06:54:24) was recorded after the aircraft passed the end of the runway at a speed of 155 KCAS. The aircraft became airborne approximately 670 feet (205 m) beyond the paved surface and flew a distance of 325 feet (100 m). The lower aft fuselage then struck an earthen berm supporting an instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna. The aircraft's tail separated on impact, and the rest of the aircraft continued in the air for another 1200 feet (370 m) before it struck terrain and burst into flames.  FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:  1. The Bradley take-off weight was likely used to generate the Halifax take-off performance data, which resulted in incorrect V speeds and thrust setting being transcribed to the take-off data card. 2. The incorrect V speeds and thrust setting were too low to enable the aircraft to take off safely for the actual weight of the aircraft. 3. It is likely that the flight crew member who used the Boeing Laptop Tool (BLT) to generate take-off performance data did not recognize that the data were incorrect for the planned take-off weight in Halifax. It is most likely that the crew did not adhere to the operator's procedures for an independent check of the take-off data card. 4. The pilots of MKA1602 did not carry out the gross error check in accordance with the company's standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the incorrect take-off performance data were not detected. 5. Crew fatigue likely increased the probability of error during calculation of the take-off performance data, and degraded the flight crew's ability to detect this error. 6. Crew fatigue, combined with the dark take-off environment, likely contributed to a loss of situational awareness during the take-off roll. Consequently, the crew did not recognize the inadequate take-off performance until the aircraft was beyond the point where the take-off could be safely conducted or safely abandoned. 7. The aircraft's lower aft fuselage struck a berm supporting a localizer antenna, resulting in the tail separating from the aircraft, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. 8. The company did not have a formal training and testing program on the BLT, and it is likely that the user of the BLT in this occurrence was not fully conversant with the software."

	   Atlantic Ocean",En route,Military,Windhoek-Hosea Kutako International Airport (WDH/FYWH),Georgetown-Wideawake Field (ASI/FHAW),"Some 65 nautical miles west off the Namibian coast, a US Air Force Lockheed C-141B Starlifter collided with a German Air Force Tupolev 154M in mid-air. Both aircraft crashed, killing all 33 occupants. The Tupolev 154M (11+02), call sign GAF074, operated on a flight from Cologne/Bonn Airport in Germany to Kaapstad, South Africa. En route refueling stops were planned at Niamey, Niger and Windhoek, Namibia. On board were ten crew members and 14 passengers.  The C-141B, (65-9405), call sign REACH 4201, had delivered UN humanitarian supplies to Windhoek and was returning to the U.S. via Georgetown on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. On board were nine crew members. GAF074 departed Niamey, Niger at 10:35 UTC. REACH 4201 took off from Windhoek at 14:11 UTC and climbed to its filed for and assigned cruise level of 35,000 feet (FL350).  At the same time, GAF074 was not at its filed for cruise level of FL390 but was still at its initially assigned cruise level FL350. Windhoek ATC was in sole and continuous radio contact with REACH 4201, with no knowledge of GAF 074's movement. Luanda ATC was in radio contact with GAF074, but they were not in radio contact with REACH 4201. Luanda ATC did receive flight plans for both aircraft but a departure message for only REACH 4201. At 15:10 UTC both aircraft collided at FL350 and crashed into the sea.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The primary cause of this accident, in my opinion, was GAF 074 flying a cruise level (FL350) which was not the level they had filed for (FL390). Neither FL350 nor FL390 were the correct cruise levels for that aircraft's magnetic heading according to International Civil Aviation Organization regulations. The appropriate cruise level would have been FL290, FL330, FL370, FL410, etc.   A substantially contributing factor was ATC agency Luanda's poor management of air traffic through its airspace. While ATC communications could be improved, ATC agency û Luanda did have all the pertinent information it needed to provide critical advisories to both aircraft. If ATC agency Luanda was unable to contact GAF 074, it should have used other communication means (HF radio, telefax or telephone) to contact REACH 4201 through ATC agency Windhoek, as outlined in governing documents.  Another substantially contributing factor was the complicated and sporadic operation of the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN). Routing of messages to affected air traffic control agencies is not direct and is convoluted, creating unnecessary delays and unfortunate misroutings. Specifically, ATC agency Windhoek did not receive a flight plan or a departure message on GAF 074, which could have been used by the controllers to identify the conflict so they could have advised REACH 4201. In my opinion, the absence of TCAS was not a cause or substantially contributing factor, but the presence of a fully operational TCAS could have prevented the accident."" (William H.C.

The flight engineer conducted an external inspection of portions of the aircraft and the passengers then reboarded. Following engine start-up, the aircraft was taxied via taxiway ""D"" and runway 13 to runway 22 for departure. Takeoff on runway 22 was begun from the intersection of runway 13 at 06:45. The aircraft proceeded down the runway and rotated in the vicinity of taxiway ""A"", 51 seconds after brake release at an airspeed of about 167 KIAS. The aircraft gained little altitude after rotation, the speed reached 172 KIAS and began to decrease again, causing the DC-8 to descend. The airplane crossed the Trans-Canada Highway at a very low altitude. The pitch angle increased, but the aircraft continued to descend until it struck downsloping terrain approximately 3,000 feet beyond the departure end of the runway. The DC-8 broke up and burst into flames.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Canadian Aviation Safety Board was unable to determine the exact sequence of events which led to this accident. The Board believes, however, that the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, shortly after lift-off, the aircraft experienced an increase in drag and reduction in lift which resulted in a stall at low altitude from which recovery was not possible. The most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice contamination on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing. Other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the number four engine and inappropriate take-off reference speeds may have compounded the effects of the contamination.""  Four members of the CASB filed a dissenting opinion with a different probable cause: ""An in-flight fire that may have resulted from detonations of undetermined origin brought about catastrophic system failures."""

	   Pakistan",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Lahore-Allama Iqbal International Airport (LHE/OPLA),Karachi-Jinnah International Airport (KHI/OPKC),"Pakistan International Airlines flight 8303, an Airbus A320, crashed on approach to Karachi-Jinnah International Airport (KHI), Pakistan. There were 91 passengers on board and 8 crew members. Two passengers survived the accident. The flight departed Lahore at 13:05 hours local time (08:05 UTC) and was expected to arrive at Karachi about 14:45 (09:45 UTC).  Departure from Lahore and cruising flight were uneventful. The flight crew did not follow standard callouts and did not observe CRM aspects during most parts of flight. According to the Pakistani Aviation Minister, the crew were engaged in conversations related to the coronavirus. The controller at Karachi East Area Control cleared the flight for the Nawabshah 2A arrival procedure, and advised to expect an ILS approach for runway 25L. The flight was later cleared at pilot's discretion to report direct MAKLI, a waypoint 15 nautical miles at a radial of 075 from the Karachi VOR, and descend to FL100, and later re-cleared for FL50.  The aircraft changed over to the Karachi Approach controller and was cleared to descend down to 3000 ft, before reaching MAKLI. The aircraft ended up higher than the required descend profile. At MAKLI the aircraft was at 9780 ft and at about 245 knots IAS. In order to manage the descent and lose the additional height, the OPEN DES mode was selected via the FCU, both autopilots were disengaged and speed brakes were extended. Karachi Approach inquired ""confirm track mile comfortable for descend"" and later advised to take an orbit, so that the aircraft could capture the required descent profile. No orbit was executed and the effort to intercept the glide slope and ILS localizer was continued. At 7221 ft at around 10.5 NM from runway 25L the undercarriage was extended. Karachi Approach advised repeatedly about the excessive height but the flight continued the approach. At an altitude of 1740 feet and at a distance slightly less than 5 nautical miles from runway 25L the undercarriage as raised. At this time, the aircraft had intercepted the localizer as well as the glide slope. Flaps 1 were selected at 243 knots IAS. Over-speed and EGPWS warnings were then triggered. Since the approach to land was continued, Karachi Approach instead of changing over the aircraft to the Tower controller, contacted Karachi Tower by phone to request landing clearance. The Tower controller confirmed clearance to land without observing the abnormality that the landing gears were not extended. Karachi Approach then cleared the aircraft to land. At 500 ft, the airspeed was 220 knots IAS at a slat/flap configuration 3, and a descent rate of 2000 ft/min. Several warnings and alerts sounded in the cockpit, such as overspeed, landing gear not down and ground proximity alerts. The landing was carried out with landing gears retracted. The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines. The flight crew applied reverse engine power and initiated a braking action. Both engines scraped the runway at various locations causing damage to both of them.  The Tower controller observed the gear-up landing and contacted the Karachi Approach controller by phone. Subsequently Karachi Approach did not relay this to the flight crew. The landing was discontinued and a go-around was executed.  At 14:35 the flight crew radioed that they were going around and requested another ILS approach to runway 25L. The controller instructed the flight to turn left heading 110 and climb to 3000 feet. Four minutes later the flight reported they had ""lost engines"" and subsequently declared a Mayday. The controller cleared the flight to land with both runways (25L and 25R) available. Both engines failed one by one and subsequently the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed to power the essential aircraft systems.  The aircraft was not able to reach the runway and crashed about 1340 meters short of runway 25L in a residential area named Model Colony. It was a slow speed impact with a high angle of attack The aircraft broke up and a large post-impact fire erupted. A total of 12 houses and multiple cars suffered major damages due to the crash. One person on the ground died of her injuries on May 31.  Primary Causes 1 Aircraft made Gears Up landing where both Engines’ nacelle made contact with R/W. Both Engines were damaged causing loss of Engine Oil and lubrication which resulted in failure of both Engines during Go-Around. 2 Non-adherence to SOPs and disregard of ATC instructions during the event flight. 3 Lack of communication between the ATC and the flight crew regarding Gears Up landing particularly once aircraft was on the R/W. Contributing Causes 1 Ineffective implementation of FDA programme. 2 FDA regulatory oversight programme was ineffective in producing sufficient and timely improvement. 3 Lack of clear and precise regulations to restrict flying while fasting. 4 Inadequate level of CRM application during the event flight."

A refuelling stop was planned at Tamanrasset (TMR), Algeria. Visibility at Tamanrasset was poor due to dust haze in the early morning daylight. Three landing attempts were made. The fourth approach was not in alignment with either of the two runways. The airplane began to break up during the landing roll, collided with a light pole and a building."

	   Canada",Approach,Cargo,"Toronto International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG/CYEG)","On the ground at Toronto cattle pens were installed and a cargo of 86 cattle was loaded. The Boeing 707 took off at 04:47 GMT for a flight to Edmonton. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 08:29 the flight was cleared for a straight in back-course ILS approach to runway 29. The first officer, who had just been promoted to Boeing 707 operations, was to perform the approach in blowing snow conditions. This approach was the first one after a 6-week holiday, so he lacked recent Boeing 707-experience. With the added factors of fatigue, turbulent air, and a heavily loaded aircraft the situation would have become extremely difficult. At some point late in the approach the captain took over control of the aircraft and tried to arrest the sink rate. The plane contacted poplar trees, 3137 m short of the runway. It struck the ground a glancing blow, and the tail fin struck powerlines. The aircraft finally struck a large ridge in the middle of a gravel pit. The cockpit section and a forward portion of the fuselage broke away and 86 cattle, the cargo on board, shot forward through the open front section of the fuselage and were thrown a distance of up to 100 m. A fire erupted.  Summary The combination of circumstances leading to this accident were such that the margins of operating safety were seriously compromised by the time the aircraft entered the final stages of its approach which was being made in difficult weather conditions and without glidslope guidance to the runway in use. The flight crew members being fatigued, would have found it difficult to concentrate fully on the task at hand without any added difficulty of having their attention diverted by some untoward event. This probably applied particularly in the case of the Captain whose primary function at this stage of the flight was to closely monitor the First Officer's handling of the aircraft. However, if an interruption to  the essential electrical system had occurred he probably would have divided his attention between monitoring the First Officer's and the Flight Engineer's activities. And so, at the most vital stage of the approach, the First Officer, inexperienced as he was wlth the aircraft type and its equipment, may have been left to cope with the approach which was probably beyond his capabilities. With the added factors of fatigue, turbulent air, and a heavily loaded aircraft the situation would have become extremely difficult. In these circumstances, if the Captain's attention had been momentarily distracted, control of the aircraft would have been jeopardized at an altitude too low to effect recovery."
Thursday 17 March 1988,13:17,Boeing 727-21,Avianca,43848,143,"25 km NW of Cúcuta-Camilo Daza Airport (CUC) - 
	   Colombia",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Cúcuta-Camilo Daza Airport (CUC/SKCC),Cartagena-Rafael Núñez Airport (CTG/SKCG),"Avianca flight 410 was destroyed when it impacted El Espartillo Mountain after takeoff from Cúcuta Airport in Colombia. All 143 occupants sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft, a Boeing 727-21 operated flight 410 from Bucaramanga to Barranquilla, with en route stops at Cúcuta and Cartagena. Because the originally planned aircraft was not available, HK-1716 was prepared for the flight. This resulted in a departure delay of 2 hours and 30 minutes. The flight landed at Cúcuta at 12:28 local time.  At 13:06, the pilot requested clearance to start, but he was told there was a 10-minute delay because of three incoming aircraft. The crew immediately requested clearance for a climb on course (""Why not clear us to climb on course to avoid delaying this flight further? We're: pretty far behind"") and the tower granted their request at 13:08: ""OK, cleared for engine start, climb on course VMC, report ready to taxi, temperature 28°"".  This, added to the anomalous presence in the cockpit of another pilot whose loquaciousness continually disrupted the work of all the crew members, affected the way in which the pilot supervised the actions of his co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying. There was no crew briefing, nor did the pilot-in command give any instructions for the VMC departure.  Two minutes later the tower controller instructed them to taxi to runway 33. At 13:12 the tower reported, ""Cleared to Cartagena via Uniform Whisky 19, Whisky 7, Whisky 10, climb and maintain two six zero after takeoff, climb on course VMC, QNH ....correction transponder Alpha 2216"". Take-off clearance was issued at 13:13. The initial climb path followed the extended runway centre line to the inner marker, at which point the aircraft entered a continuous left turn. At 13:17 the pilot said to the copilot, ""In any case, start turning right."" Subsequently the aircraft struck the peak of El Espartillo at an elevation of 6,343 feet.  PROBABLE CAUSES: 1. Active:  A. Personnel factors - Pilot-in-command - Procedures, Regulations and instructions a) Diverted attention from operation of aircraft and failed to exercise adequate and constant supervision over the performance of his co-pilot; b) Tolerated inappropriate interference with cockpit discipline by authorized persons with access to the flight deck; c) Continued VFR flight into IMC. B. Personnel factor - Non-crew pilot in cockpit - Procedures, regulations and instructions Interfered constantly with the normal operation of the aircraft, distracting the crew from the efficient execution of their duties.  2.    Passive A.    Personnel factor- Crew- Procedures, regulations and instructions: lack of teamwork on the part of the crew, reflected in the failure to coordinate the instructions needed to take off and climb out in VMC using a profile established in accordance with the specific conditions. B. Other factors - Meeting the schedule: The delays resulting from the change of aircraft for mechanical reasons contributed to the decision by the pilot-in-command to give inappropriate support to company priorities and request to depart, rather than waiting as recommended by the Control Tower, in order to avoid adding to the delays already experienced."""

The Fokker F-28 jet departed Jacksonville at 17:15 and was cleared into the LaGuardia area without significant additional delays. The first officer accomplished an ILS approach to LaGuardia's runway 04 to minimums and initiated braking on the landing roll. Ramp congestion delayed taxiing to the parking gate. The airplane was parked at Gate 1 at approximately 19:49, 1 hour and 6 minutes behind schedule. After the airplane was parked at Gate 1, the line mechanic who met the flight was advised by the captain that the aircraft was ""good to go."" The captain left the cockpit and the first officer prepared for the next leg to Cleveland , OH (CLE) that had originally been scheduled to depart at 19:20. Snow was falling as the F-28 was prepared for departure. The airplane was de-iced with Type I fluid with a 50/50 water/glycol mixture, using two trucks. After the de-icing, about 20:26, one of the trucks experienced mechanical problems and was immobilized behind the airplane, resulting in a pushback delay of about 20 minutes. The captain then requested a second de-icing of the airplane. The airplane was pushed away from the gate to facilitate de-icing by one de-icing truck. The second de-icing was completed at approximately 21:00. At 21:05:37, the first officer contacted the LaGuardia ground controller and requested taxi clearance. The airplane was cleared to taxi to runway 13. At 21:07:12, the flightcrew switched to the LaGuardia ground sequence controller, which they continued to monitor until changing to the tower frequency at 21:25:42. The before-takeoff checklist was completed during the taxi. Engine anti-ice was selected for both engines during taxi. The captain announced that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and he placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder. The captain announced they would use US Air's contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps. They would use a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots. The first officer used the ice (wing) inspection light to examine the right wing a couple of times. He did not see any contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore did not consider a third de-icing.  Flight 405 was cleared into the takeoff and hold position on runway 13 at 21:33:50. The airplane was cleared for takeoff at 21:34:51. The takeoff was initiated and the first officer made a callout of 80 knots, and, at 21:35:25, made a V1 callout. At 21:35:26, the first officer made a VR callout. Approximately 2.2 seconds after the VR callout, the nose landing gear left the ground. Approximately 4.8 seconds later, the sound of stick shaker began. Six stall warnings sounded. The airplane began rolling to the left. As the captain leveled the wings, they headed toward the blackness over the water. The crew used right rudder to maneuver the airplane back toward the ground and avoid the water. They continued to try to hold the nose up to impact in a flat attitude.  The airplane came to rest partially inverted at the edge of Flushing Bay, and parts of the fuselage and cockpit were submerged in water. After the airplane came to rest, several small residual fires broke out on the water and on the wreckage debris.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the airline industry and the Federal Aviation Administration to provide flight crews with procedures, requirements, and criteria compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing and the decision by the flight crew to take off without positive assurance that the airplane's wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de-icing. The ice contamination on the wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control after lift-off. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inappropriate procedures used by, and inadequate coordination between, the flight crew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air speed."""

While descending on Airway G452 the crew contacted Delhi: ""Good evening 1907. Passing through 230 for 180, 74 miles from DPN [the Delhi Airport beacon]"". The controller then cleared the flight to descend to and report at FL150. In the meantime, a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 had departed Delhi at 18:32 for a passenger flight to Dhahran. Flight SV763 followed the Parvi SID and reported approaching FL100. The Delhi controller cleared the flight, which was also on Airway G452, to climb to FL140. Because Flight 1907 was approaching from the opposite side, the controller told SV763: ""Maintain level 140, Standby for higher."" A little later, Flight 1907 reported reaching FL150 at 46 miles from the airport. The controller then responded: ""Roger. Maintain 150. Identified traffic 12 o'clock, reciprocal Saudia Boeing 747, 14 miles. Report in sight."" The Kazakhstan crew replied by querying the distance to which the controller answered: ""Fourteen miles now, roger 1907."" When no reply followed he again warned: ""Traffic in 13 miles, level 140."" Apparently the Kazakh aircraft had descended below its assigned altitude and was flying at 14500 feet. A few seconds later seconds later the Ilyushin had descended another 310 feet. Shortly afterwards both aircraft collided, plummeted down in flames and crashed in an arid farming area.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The root and approximate cause of the collision was the unauthorised descending by the Kazak aircraft to FL-140 and failure to maintain the assigned FL-150.  The factors contributing to the unauthorised descent of Kazak aircraft to FL-140, departing from the assigned FL-150, were: i) inadequate knowledge of English language of Kazak pilot, resulting in wrong interpretations of ATC instructions. ii) poor airmanship and lack of proper CRM (Crew Resource Management) skill on the part of PIC (Pilot-in-Command) compounded by leadership quality lacking in him. iii) Casual attitude of the crew and lack of coordination in the performance of their respective duties by crew of Kazak aircraft. iv) Absence of standard callouts from any crew member."

	   Suriname",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM),Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport (PBM/SMJP),"Surinam Airways (SLM) carried out regular flights between Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS) and Paramaribo (PBM) using McDonnell Douglas DC-8-60 planes. One of these was a US-registered plane, N1809E, named ""Anthony Nesty"". The air crew was furnished by Air Crew International (ACI). The contract between Surinam Airways and ACI stipulated that ACI would furnish SLM with qualified crew members who held FAA certificates and who met the regulatory requirements to fly the DC-8. ACI did not provide for proficiency checks but left it to the individual pilots to meet the training and other requirements of their profession. One of the captains provided by ACI was involved in several incidents while operating on SLM flights. After investigation, SLM instructed ACI not to use this captain in future SLM assignments. However, he still acted as a crew member on several flights since.  The captain was again scheduled on the accident flight PY764. According to regulations, the captain was not even qualified to act as pilot-in-command of that flight because of his age. He was 66 years old and Surinam regulations stipulated that ""the holder of a pilot certificate is not authorized to act as pilot during commercial flights when he/she has reached age 60"". Also, his most recent proficiency check flight was on a GA-7 Cougar twin instead of a DC-8. Flight 764 departed Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport at 23:25 (June 6) on a flight to Paramaribo (PBM). The en route part of the flight was uneventful and about 20 minutes before arrival in Paramaribo the crew received the 07:00 UTC weather for Zanderij Airport: Wind calm, visibility 900 m in fog, temperature/dewpoint 22°C/22°C. This caught the crew by surprise since the previous weather information had included a visibility of 6 km. Because the ILS was not to be used for operational purposes, the copilot said: ""We don't legally have an ILS ... we have to use it"". The captain responded affirmatively. The crew were confident that they could land because they assumed that the fog was localized given the fact that they were able to see the airport during the descent. Zanderij Tower then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 10. The captain tuned in to the ILS and instructed the first officer to set the final approach course for the published VOR/DME approach on the first officer's side. During the approach the first officer reported that he could see the airport:""Runway's at twelve o'clock"". A minute later he commented ""A little bit of low fog comin' up I reckon just a little bit"". He was still able to see the runway and reported the runway in sight. The DC-8 then entered some stratus clouds the captain told the first officer to ""Tell him [tower controller] to turn the runway lights up ... Tell him to put the runway lights bright"". The captain attempted to capture the unreliable ILS glide slope signal, but failed to capture it. The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded several times: ""Glideslope ... glideslope..."" until it was deactivated. The captain was flying the aircraft below the minimum altitude for the ILS/DME approach procedure (260 ft asl) as well as below the minimum descent altitude for the VOR/DME approach procedure (560 ft). The first officer called out: ""Two hundred feet"". Thirteen seconds later the no. 2 engine contacted a tree. The right wing then struck another tree, causing the aircraft to roll, striking the ground inverted. The airplane broke up and a fire erupted.  CAUSE: ""The Commission determines: a) That as a result of the captain's glaring carelessness and recklessness the aircraft was flown below the published minimum altitudes during the approach and consequently collided with a tree. b) As underlying factor in the accident was the failure of SLM's operational management to observe the pertinent regulations as well as the procedures prescribed in the SLM Operations Manual concerning qualification and certification during recruitment and employment of the crew members furnished by ACI."""

At 19:50:25, at an altitude of just 100 m, the flight crew reported the failure of engine no.1. The flight crew turned left in an effort to return to the airport. The aircraft struck trees on a hillside, 86 m above airfield elevation, and crashed.  It was determined that the crew failed to select engine anti-ice before takeoff. Additionally the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft was exceeded by 419 kg."
Saturday 4 May 2002,13:35,BAC One-Eleven 525FT,EAS Airlines,24644,73,"3 km SW of Kano-Aminu Kano International Airport (KAN) - 
	   Nigeria",Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Kano-Aminu Kano International Airport (KAN/DNKN),Lagos-Murtala Muhammed International Airport (LOS/DNMM),"EAS Airlines flight 4226, BAC One-Eleven (5N-ESF), crashed in a residential area after takeoff from Kano Airport, Nigeria. Four of the 77 occupants survived the accident and at least 30 persons on the ground were killed. The One-Eleven, 5N-ESF, was bought by EAS Airlines from Romanian airline TAROM and joined the EAS fleet on August 2, 2001. On March 9, 2002, however, its No.2 engine (Rolls-Royce Spey 512-14DW) developed some vibration and loss of power output as a result of which the aircraft was grounded, awaiting engine replacement. Another One-Eleven aircraft in the EAS Airlines fleet, 5N-ESD, developed a ground-cooling problem on the April 30, which the operator estimated 7 days to be repaired. Due to the operational demand, the operator then decided to transfer one engine from 5N-ESD onto 5N-ESF's No.2 position. Thus the aircraft resumed flying on May 2, 2002. On May 4, the aircraft operated flight EXW4227 from Lagos to Jos and Kano and flight 4226 from Kano back to Lagos. The flight to Kano was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 11:40 UTC. A total of 47 passengers remained on board and 22 passengers boarded the flight for Lagos.  At 12:22 UTC the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 23 for departure. The Tower controller reported a temperature of 36°C with wind from 170 degrees at 7 knots and issued takeoff clearance. Takeoff was commenced at 12:28 but the acceleration seemed slow to the Tower controller. The aircraft was not able to lift off the runway and continued onto the 60 m blast pad and continued onto the adjacent grass terrain for 180 metres, which raised a huge burst of dust knocking off two approach lights. After becoming airborne the undercarriage remained down and the aircraft barely climbed. Engine power was lost due to dust ingestion during the overrun. Flight 4226 then impacted the Gwammaja Quarters residential area, some 3 km past the end of the runway. The aircraft broke up and caught fire.  The investigation was severely hampered due to the uncontrollable crowd of people, for many days in the area after the crash. Also, the Cockpit Voice Recorder was never found and the Flight Data Recorder seemed to have never worked on flights in Nigeria.  An investigation of both engines showed that there was no pre-crash failure which could account for the long takeoff run. Other factors like air temperature, runway elevation, centre of gravity, takeoff weight (39243 kg, which was below the mtow of 47,400kg) were all discounted.  The investigators noted that the main 3000 m-long runway at Kano was closed for work and runway 05/23 was in use, which had a length of 2600 meters. Performance calculations showed that the aircraft needed 2347 metres. It was considered that the flight crew was accustomed to be operating from longer runways in Nigeria and this was likely the first time they were operating out of a 2600 m long runway. Contingencies of operating on the shorter runway were probably not seriously considered before the commencement of the takeoff roll.  Subsequently, after becoming airborne, the undercarriage remained extended which caused additional drag and the rate of climb would have increased by 200ft/min had it been raised. Together with the decrease in engine power due to dust ingestion led to the aircraft's failure to climb to a safe altitude.  Probable cause: The crew's inability to get the airplane airborne within the safe parameter of the available runway length. The contributive factor was the breakdown of the crew's cockpit coordination procedure in executing a coercive reaction of initially,  i) getting the aircraft airborne;  ii) improving its climb performance by raising up the gear and  iii) flying the airplane to safe height before thinking of the next line of action."

After an uneventful flight, the crew contacted Tenerife North Airport Approach Control at 13:14, informing them that they were at FL110 and at 14 nautical miles from the TFN VOR/DME. Approach Control replied, ""Dan Air one zero zero eight, cleared to the Foxtrot Papa beacon via Tango Foxtrot November, flight level one one zero expect runway one two, no delay."" The Dan Air crew repeated the clearance and requested meteorological information, which was given as: ""OK runway in use one two, the wind one two zero zero five, visibility six from seven kilometres clouds, two oktas at one two zero metres, plus four oktas at two five zero metres, plus two oktas at three five zero metres, November Hotel one zero three, temperature one six, dew point one, and drizzle."" Approximately one minute later Approach Control told the aircraft to descend and maintain FL60. Receipt of this message was acknowledged by the aircraft, whereupon the controller immediately requested it to indicate its distance from the TFN beacon. The crew replied that it was at 7 NM from TFN. At 13:18:48 UTC the aircraft notified Approach Control that it had just passed TFN and that it was heading for the 'FP' beacon. The controller then informed them of an unpublished hold over Foxtrot Papa: ""Roger, the standard holding over Foxtrot Papa is inbound heading one five zero, turn to the left, call you back shortly."" Dan Air 1008 only replied ""Roger"" without repeating the information received, which was not compulsory under the ICAO regulations in force at the time of the accident. Almost one minute later, the aircraft the crew reported: ""Dan Air one zero zero eight, Foxtrot Papa level at six zero, taking up the hold"" and Tenerife APP replied: ""Roger"". Instead of passing overhead FP, the flight had passed this navaid at 1.59 NM to the South. Instead of entering the 255 radial, the Boeing 727 continued its trajectory in the direction of 263 degrees for a duration of more than 20 seconds, entering an area with a minimum safety altitude (MSA) of 14500 ft. The co-pilot at that point said: ""Bloody strange hold, isn't it?"" The captain remarked ""Yes, doesn't isn't parallel with the runway or anything."" The flight engineer then also made some remarks about the holding procedure. Approach control then cleared them down to 5000 feet.  The captain then remarked: ""Hey did he say it was one five zero inbound?"". It appears that at this moment the information received on the holding flashed back to the Captain's mind, making him realize that his manoeuvre was taking him to magnetic course 150 degrees outbound from 'FP', whereas the information received was ""inbound"" on the holding, heading 150 degrees towards 'FP'. The copilot responded: ""Inbound yeh"". ""I don't like that"", the captain said. The GPWS alarm sounded. The captain interrupted his left hand turn and entered a right hand turn and ordered an overshoot. They overflew a valley, temporarily deactivating the GPWS warning. The copilot suggested: ""I suggest a heading of one two two actually and er take us through the overshoot, ah."" But the captain continued with the turn to the right, because he was convinced that the turn he had been making to the left was taking him to the mountains. The captain contacted Approach Control at 13:21: ""Er ... Dan Air one zero zero eight, we've had a ground proximity Warning."" About two seconds later the aircraft flew into the side of a mountain at an altitude of approximately 5450 ft (1662 m) and at 11.5 km off course.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain, without taking into account the altitude at which he was flying, took the aircraft into an area of very high ground, and for this reason he did not maintain the correct safety distance above the ground, as was his obligation. Contributing factors were:  a) the performance of a manoeuvre without having clearly defined it;   b) imprecise navigation on the part of the captain, showing his loss of bearings;   c) lack of teamwork between captain and co-pilot;   d) the short space of time between the information given and the arrival at 'FP';   e) the fact that the holding was not published"" (Spanish report) UK authorities agreed in general with the report, but added some comments to give the report 'a proper balance': 1. The information concerning the holding pattern at FP, which was transmitted by ATC, was ambiguous and contributed directly to the disorientation of the crew. 2. No minimum safe altitude computed for holding pattern. 3. Track for holding pattern at 'FP' is unrealistic."

All 119 on board were killed. The aircraft was approaching Cuenca in clear weather with patches of ground fog near the airport. The controller cleared the flight for an instrument approach to runway 23. The flight crew, however, decided to perform a direct visual approach. After crossing the El Tablon VOR they had the runway in sight and continued the approach. From then on the GPWS began to sound: 'Terrain, Terrain, Pull up!'. The pilots did not respond to these warnings and continued the approach. Meanwhile, the first officer suggested to select flaps to 40 degrees and descend to 8700 feet, which was below the minimum altitude of 9500 feet. The aircraft descended rapidly at about 1500 ft/min. During the descent the aircraft entered clouds. The flight crew likely focused on obtaining visual contact with the ground, without paying attention to the altitude.  The aircraft descended until it impacted terrain at 8548 feet.    when it struck a ridge with its tail and crashed into a hilly area about 1 mile short of the runway."

It departed Chiclayo at 08:17 and climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL190, which was reached approx. ten minutes after takeoff. The F-28 followed the V-3 airway, heading 075deg until 08:32. The crew then turned to the left heading 060deg, maintaining FL190 until 08:36. The flight then descended to FL130. After reaching that altitude five minutes later, the crew extended the speedbrakes in order to decelerate from 280 knots to 210 knots. Fifty seconds later, with the speedbrakes still extended, the crew turned to a heading of 135deg, aligning the plane with Chachapoyas' runway 13. The turn was accomplished in 45 seconds with a 30deg bank angle course change in 45 seconds. Shortly afterwards the Fellowship struck Cerro Coloque at an altitude of 10350 feet. Rescue workers found the wreckage two days after the crash. Until 1995 this F-28 was used as the Peruvian Presidential plane.  PROBABLE ROOT CAUSES: 1.- PROBABLE MAIN CAUSE. The probable cause of the accident of the aircraft Fokker F-28, MK1000, OB-1396 of the company TANS-PERU, is the Impact Into Terrain without Loss of Control - CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) caused by complacency (overconfidence) and lack of effective communication between the technical crew, which leads to the total loss of situational awareness. 2.- PROBABLE SECONDARY CAUSES 2.1 Lack of compliance with Standard Operating Procedures. The CVR transcript shows that the Technical Crew was not alert, nor did they make any operational indication such as breafing or check list about the descent to the Chachapoyas airfield. 2.2 Lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) There is no formal operational communication, in the CVR hearing there is a lot of informality and many comments out of place for a professional technical operation. 2.3 Loss of Situational Awareness. From the CVR hearing it can be extracted that the crew due to complacency (overconfidence) did not comply with the rules and procedures established for the operation of this route and airport. The alertness of the Technical Crew was not adequate for the operation phase. 3.- CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 3.1 Death of the Co-Pilot's father, 4 days before the date of the flight, could contribute as a stress, fatigue and depression agent, which could influence his professional performance. 3.2 The delay in the crew's payments and/or bonuses could have caused a stressful situation, which in the short, medium or long term contributes to fatigue, thus decreasing professional performance, which would affect flight safety. 3.3 Organizational system and operational environment. The constant changes of management personnel cause labor instability within the company, a situation that could be an agent of stress that affects human performance in any field. 4.- CONTRIBUTING HUMAN ERRORS The following Human Errors were observed in the analysis of the performance of this flight: 1) Poor judgment 2) Poor planning 3) Inadequate monitoring 4) Poor visual perspective 5) Poor visual perception 6) Operational complacency 7) Omitted procedures 8) Disorientation due to loss of situational awareness"

At 1600 m the DC-8 finally became airborne and climbed to 30 m before crashing into the ground, left wing-first. The wreckage came to a halt at 2300 m.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""(1) The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. (2) The flight crew's lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. (3) The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91."""

The tower controller informed the flight that weather at the airport was below minima and that improvement would be slow. The flight crew then decided to hold over Lima Romeo Alpha and said they would report when holding.  Shortly thereafter they informed the tower that they would make an approach down to minima to get a more precise idea of the weather and would hold thereafter. The controller switched on the VASIS and at 09:21 informed the flight that visibility was around 350 m, although he could not see the VASIS at the threshold of runway 22. The flight then reported at 3000 feet beginning the approach. At 09:23 the controller reported a visibility of 600 m. At 09:24 the pilot said he would attempt to land, that he was 2200 feet on approach and had not yet entered clouds. At 09:28 ATC reported 800 m visibility, but that a light breeze was coming up and fog was again closing in from the sea. The crew reported to the tower that they had descended to minima. Since the ground could not be seen, they would therefore begin to hold. At 09:32 the flight crew reported holding at 6000 feet and requested to be informed of any change that might take place.  At 09:34 the controller reported a visibility of 400 m, that the VASIS was still visible. The flight crew then tried to make another attempt to land. At 09:36 the flight crew reported passing the LRA VOR on approach. The controller answered that the lights of the VASIS were no longer visible and that some fog had collected over the runway threshold. The pilot then decided to resume holding. Weather gradually improved and at 10:20 ATC reported a horizontal visibility of 1500 m and a vertical visibility of 150 m which improved to 250-300 m within three minutes. The pilot acknowledged and said he was leaving 5000 feet for approach. At 10:31 the flight reported passing LRA.

During the start-up of the centre (no. 2) engine, a spontaneous rotation of the engine's turbo compressor was noted twice. When all engines were started the ""dangerous rotation of starter"" warning light illuminated. The light wouldn't go out by using the starter turn off button. The operations manual didn't describe the actions to be taken in this situation and the crew thought the warning was false, thinking the starter could only spin during engine start-up. All engine parameters seemed normal and the crew decided to continue. The aircraft took off from runway 12 at 11:59 hours local time. Four minutes after takeoff the starter if engine no.2 suffered an uncontained failure. Turbine fragments severed fuel lines and a fire erupted in the area of the APU and the no.2 engine. The flight crew shut down engine no.2 and activated all three fire extinguishing bottles. The fire however could not be controlled. At 12:05 the flight crew radioed that they had an engine fire and were returning to the airport. Meanwhile the fire caused damage to hydraulic lines, which led to a loss of hydraulics. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed amongst farm buildings.  PROBABLE CAUSE: Break-up of the no.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines.

At 13:58:20 the flight crew contacted Orly approach and reported a ""problem with fire on board"". An emergency descent was requested. At 13:59 clearance was given to descend to 3000 feet for a runway 07 landing, making a straight-in approach possible. While the situation on board was getting worse (smoke entering the cockpit and passengers becoming asphyxiated), a clearance to descend to 2000 feet was given at 14:01:10. The flight crew put on oxygen masks as smoke was making it impossible to read the instruments. At 14:03 the pilot decided to make an emergency landing 5 km short of the runway with gear down and flaps at 80deg. The Boeing approached with considerable nose-up attitude, in a slight left bank. The aircraft truncated some small trees and made a heavy landing on a field. Both main gears collapsed and the engines were torn off in the subsequent skid. The fuselage however, remained intact. Ten occupants (all crewmembers) evacuated the aircraft. By the time the firemen arrived (6-7 minutes later) the fire had burned through the roof and there was no sign of life. Of the four unconscious occupants the firemen could evacuate, only one survived.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A fire which appears to have started in the washbasin unit of the aft right toilet. It was detected because smoke had entered the adjacent left toilet. The fire may have been started by an electrical fault or by the carelessness of a passenger. The difficulty in locating the fire made the actions of cabin personnel ineffective. The flight crew did not have the facilities to intervene usefully from the cockpit against the spread of the fire and the invasion of smoke. The lack of visibility in the cockpit prompted the crew to decided on a forced landing. At the time of touch-down the fire was confined to the area of the aft toilets.

Although the Boeing 727 was supposed to be approaching La Paz along airway UA 320, on a 134° radial from the La Paz VOR, it veered significantly off course beyond DAKON; perhaps because the crew were maneuvering to avoid weather in the vicinity. The aircraft impacted the 19,600-ft. level of Mt. Illimani, a 21,000-ft. Andean peak, approximately 26 NM from the La Paz VOR/DME and 25 NM from La Paz runway 09R. Dark night, weather, and lack of visual references in the area all contributed to the crews inability to see and avoid the high terrain in their path.  A climbing expedition was organized the following summer to retrieve the flight recorders. The expedition reached the crash site and was able to dig through accumulated snow and examine the wreckage. However, bad weather and altitude sickness forced the expedition to turn back without recovering the recorders. Early June 2016 an expedition found parts of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder containers. Magnetic tape segments that were recovered were not the ¼-inch width tape from a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder."

The plane took off from Ras al Khaimah runway 34 at 23:11 and climbed slowly to a height of 180 m, accelerating to 400 km/h. As the flaps were retracted, the GPWS sounded and the pilot incorrectly moved the control column forward. The aircraft flew into the sea and broke up.  Cause: The Captain failed to react to the GPWS warning in accordance with company and manufacturer's instructions and instead his actions resulted in a descent into terrain without any vertical awareness. Contributory cause: The aircraft was overloaded by persons unknown and the resultant lack of performance may have influenced the Captain's incorrect reaction to the GPWS warning and effected the subsequent recovery performance of the aircraft."

	   United States of America",Initial climb,Cargo,"Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA)",Santo Domingo-Las Américas International Airport (SDQ/MDSD),"Fine Air Flight 101 was originally scheduled to depart Miami for Santo Domingo at 09:15 using another DC-8 airplane, N30UA, to carry cargo for Aeromar. Due to a delay of the inbound aircraft, Fine Air substituted N27UA for N30UA and rescheduled the departure for 12:00. N27UA arrived at Miami at 09:31 from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was parked at the Fine Air hangar ramp. The security guard was not aware of the airplane change, and he instructed Aeromar loaders to load the airplane in accordance with the weight distribution form he possessed for N30UA. The first cargo pallet for flight 101 was loaded onto N27UA at 10:30 and the last pallet was loaded at 12:06. The resulting center of gravity (CG) of the accident airplane was near or even aft of the airplanes aft CG limit. After the three crew members and the security guard had boarded the plane, the cabin door `was closed at 12:22. Eleven minutes later the flight obtained taxi clearance for runway 27R. The Miami tower controller cleared flight 101 for takeoff at 12:34. Takeoff power was selected and the DC-8 moved down the runway. The flightcrew performed an elevator check at 80 knots. Fourteen seconds later the sound of a thump was heard. Just after calling V1 a second thump was heard. Two seconds later the airplane rotated. Immediately after takeoff the airplane pitched nose-up and entered a stall. The DC-8 recovered briefly from the stall, and stalled again. The airplane impacted terrain in a tail first, right wing down attitude. it slid west across a road (72nd Avenue) and into the International Airport Center at 28th Street and burst into flames.  Investigation showed that the center of gravity resulted in the airplanes trim being mis-set by at least 1.5 units airplane nose up, which presented the flightcrew with a pitch control problem on takeoff.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident, which resulted from the airplane being misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting that precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation, was (1) the failure of Fine Air to exercise operational control over the cargo loading process; and (2) the failure of Aeromar to load the airplane as specified by Fine Air. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor Fine Airs operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air."""

	   United States of America",Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,"Huntsville-Madison County Airport, AL (HSV/KHSV)","Atlanta Municipal Airport, GA (ATL/KATL)","Southern Airways Flight 242, a DC-9-31, operated as a scheduled passenger flight from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to Atlanta, Georgia, with an intermediate stop at Huntsville, Alabama. Flight 242 departed Muscle Shoals at 15:21 and landed at Huntsville about 15:44. About 15:54, Flight 242 departed Huntsville on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan for the Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport; there were 81 passengers and 4 crewmembers aboard. The flight's route was direct to the Rome VOR and then a Rome runway 26 profile descent to Atlanta. Its estimated time en route was 25 min and its requested en route altitude was 17,000 ft. At 15:56, the controller told Flight 242 that his radarscope was showing heavy precipitation and that the echos were about 5 nmi ahead of the flight. At 15:57:36, the controller said, ""...you're in what appears to be about the heaviest part of it now, what are your flight conditions."" Flight 242 replied, ""...we're getting a little light turbulence and...I'd say moderate rain."" At 15:57:47, the controller acknowledged Flight 242's report and told the flight to contact Memphis Center. The Memphis Center controller advised the flight that a SIGMET was current for the area. He then told Flight 242 to contact Atlanta Center. At 16:03:20, Flight 242 switched to another sector of Atlanta Center, established communications on the new frequency and reported being level at FL170. As the aircraft entered an area of rain, the flight crew began discussing the weather depicted on their radar. Based on information from the airborne radar, the captain initially decided that the storms just west of the Rome VOR were too severe to penetrate. Shortly after his initial assessment of the storm system, the captain decided to penetrate the storm area near the Rome VOR. At 16:06:41 Atlanta Center cleared Flight 242 to descend to and maintain 14,000 ft. Shortly afterwards the aircraft entered an area of heavy hail or rain, which continued for at least one minute.  The ingestion of intense rain and hail into the engines caused the rotational speed of both engines to decrease below the engine-driven electrical generator operating speeds, and resulted in normal electrical power interruption for 36 seconds. The flight crew likely advanced one or both thrust levers, restoring its generator to operation and provide normal electrical power. After establishing contact with Atlanta Center again, the flight was told to maintain 15,000 ft. At 16:09:15, Flight 242 reported to Atlanta Center, ""Okay...we just got our windshield busted and... we'll try to get it back up to 15, we're 14."" After reported that the left engine had flamed out, the flight was cleared to descend to 13,000 ft. Meanwhile both engines' high-pressure compressors began to stall severely due to ingestion of massive quantities of water. The severe compressor stalls produced an overpressure surge which deflected the compressor blades forward in the sixth stage of the low-pressure compressors; these blades clashed against the fifth-stage stator vanes and broke pieces from the blades and vanes. Pieces of blades and stator vanes were then ingested into the high-pressure compressors and damaged them severely. Continued high thrust settings following the severe damage to the high-pressure compressors probably caused severe overheating in the turbine sections of both engines, and the engines ceased to function. Shortly before normal electrical power was again, the flight crew radioed that both engines had failed. Atlanta Center told the crew to contact approach control for vectors to Dobbins Air Force Base. Power was then lost for 2 min 4 sec until the APU-driven generator restored electrical power. After establishing contact with Atlanta Approach Control the flight was told they were 20 miles from Dobbins. As the flight was descending, the captain began to doubt their ability to reach Dobbins. Cartersville was closer at 15 miles, so the controller gave vectors for Cartersville. Unable to make it to Cartersville, the crew began looking for a clear field or highway for an emergency landing. At 16:18:02, Flight 242's last transmission to Approach Control was recorded: ""... we're putting it on the highway, we're down to nothing.""  The aircraft's outboard left wing section first contacted two trees near State Spur Highway 92 south-southwest of the community of New Hope. About 0.8 miles farther north-northeast, the left wing again contacted a tree alongside the highway within the community of New Hope. The left and right wings continued to strike trees and utility poles on both sides of the highway, and 570 ft after striking the first tree in New Hope, the aircraft's left main gear contacted the highway to the left of the centerline. Almost simultaneously, the outer structure of the left wing struck an embankment, and the aircraft veered to the left and off the highway. The aircraft traveled another 1,260 ft before it came to rest. As it traveled, the aircraft struck road signs, utility poles, fences, trees, shrubs, gasoline pumps at a gas station-store, five automobiles, and a truck.  Of the 85 persons aboard Flight 242, 62 were killed, 21 were seriously injured, and 1 was slightly injured. Additionally, eight persons on the ground were killed. Within a month of the accident, one of the surviving passengers and one person on the ground both died of their injuries.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Total and unique loss of thrust from both engines while the aircraft was penetrating an area of severe thunderstorms. The loss of thrust was caused by the ingestion of massive amounts of water and hail which, in combination with thrust lever movement, induced severe stalling in and major damage to the engine compressors. Major contributing factors include the failure of the company's dispatching system to provide the flight crew with up-to-date severe weather information pertaining to the aircraft's intended route of flight, the captain's reliance on airborne weather radar for penetration of thunderstorm areas, and limitations in the FAA's ATC system which precluded the timely dissemination of real-time hazardous weather information to the flight crew."""

	   Colombia",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Panama City-Tocumen International Airport (PTY/MPTO),Rionegro/Medellín-José María Córdova Airport (MDE/SKRG),"SAM Colombia flight 501, a Boeing 727-46, was destroyed when it struck the side of a mountain near Medellín, Colombia. There were 125 passengers and seven crew members on board. All were killed. Flight 501 departed Panama City-Tocumen International Airport (PTY) on a scheduled service to Medellín (MDE) and Bogotá (BOG), Colombia. The crew reported over the Abejorral NDB beacon at FL160, approaching Medellín. The flight was then cleared to descend to FL120. The 727 had actually not yet reached the beacon, and descended into mountainous terrain. The flight struck Mount Paramo Frontino at 11663 feet. Thunderstorm activity in the area made ADF navigation more difficult and the RNG VOR/DME had been attacked by terrorists and was unserviceable.  CAUSES (translation from Spanish language report) The probable causes of the accident according to the information gathered during the present investigation were the following: A. The meteorological conditions prevailing during the flight, due to the presence of an intense convective activity, resulted in the fall of the ADF's needles, in which the low quality of the ground and flight radio aids could have had an influence, spatially disorienting the commander in the cockpit, who made errors in the navigation procedures, did not lead the crew efficiently and handed over the controls to the co-pilot to conduct the flight in the adverse conditions in which it was taking place, when he should have assumed control of the aircraft in the critical situation that existed. Finally, the lack of reaction on the part of the crew, who did not take an adequate and safe decision to climb immediately as an emergency measure. B. The controllers in Bogota and Medellin did not properly perform a positive control of the navigation of HK-2422 by not verifying the position reports of the mandatory reporting points; likewise within the transfer coordination, the appropriate parts of the updated flight plan were omitted and they forgot to warn the crew about the six minutes difference for the arrival to the true position of Abejorral. C. The lack of a VOR-DME in the Medellin control area prevented the crew from navigating with near-accurate bearings and distances to the destination airport, which would have allowed the crew to locate themselves geographically. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Lack of supervision by the company in the dispatch, before the beginning of the flight, by not providing the meteorological information available and existing on the route; which notoriously affected the attention and mood of the crew during the flight, due to the presence of meteorological conditions of intense convective activity, with the development of compact cloudiness, electrical activity, hail and ice formation. Failure in the maintenance of the ADF's installed and in service in the aircraft, which showed low quality and low reliability, due to the repetitive reports of defective operation, which were affected by unfavorable weather conditions and the emission of the radio beacon signal, presenting false indications that could cause doubt and induced in error to the crew. Lack of a more powerful radio beacon with which the range could have been properly established to support the airway from the Azapa position. Failure in the preparation of the internal flight plan of the SAM company, by omitting to edit in it, the mandatory positions of the Medellin control area (KOTIN), published in Letter No. 100 of April 3, 1993. Excess of assignments in the Medellin controllers' schedules, in charge of HK 2422 handling."

The Boeing 727, named ""Alhambra de Granada"", climbed to the cruising altitude of FL260. At 09:09 the crew were instructed to descend to FL100. Seven minutes later the copilot contacted Bilbao Tower. The controller then cleared the flight for an ILS approach: ""Iberia 610, you can continue descent, for an ILS approach to Bilbao, runway 30, wind is 100 degrees 3 knots, QNH 1025 and transition level 70."" This was confirmed by the crew. The controller subsequently offered them a direct clearance to the approach fix, which is located at 13 DME from the airport. The captain declined and decided to fly the standard approach procedure. At 09:22 flight 610 reported over the Bilbao VOR at 7000 feet, starting the standard approach procedure. The airplane further descended to 5000 feet, which it reached three minutes later. The crew switched the Altitude Alert System to 4300 ft (the minimum sector altitude is 4354 feet) and continued the descent. The altitude alert horn sounds 900 feet prior to reaching the preset altitude (approach mode) and 300 feet below that altitude (deviation mode). Since the flight had 700 feet to go, the horn would only sound at around 4000 feet. Since the crew descended below the minimum sector altitude, the altitude alert horn sounded at 4040 feet. The crew interpreted this being the approach mode alert, and continued their descent. Fifty-seven seconds after passing through the minimum sector altitude, the airplane struck the base of a structure of antennas located close to the top of Mount Oiz (3356 feet high). The left wing broke off and the remaining fuselage crashed onto the hillside, cutting a swath through the trees.  CAUSE: ""Their confidence on the automatic capture performed by the Altitude Alert System, the misinterpretation of its warnings, as well as a probable misreading of the altimeter made the crew to fly below the safety altitude, colliding into the television antennas' base, thus losing the left wing, falling to the ground with no possible control of the aircraft."""

The airplane climbed through FL90feet at 17:43 and was level at FL141 at 17:45. At 18:05, after performing several landing gear, hydraulic and engine system checks, the flight engineer told the other flight crew members that the ""next thing is our stall series. The evaluation flight profile form required that the flight crew identify and record the speed at which the stick shaker activated and the speed of the stall indication. The crew slowed the aircraft down one knot at a time.

As the flight approached Sherbrooke VORTAC 100 miles east of Montreal, Canada, at about 09:04, it advised Pan American Operations (PANOP) in New York that smoke had accumulated in the ""lower 41"" electrical compartment, and that the flight was diverting to Boston. At 09:08, Clipper 160 advised Montreal Center that they were level at FL310 and wanted to return to JFK. Montreal Center cleared Clipper 160 for a right turn to a heading of 180 degrees. At 09:10, Clipper 160 advised PANOP that it was returning to New York and that the smoke seemed to be ""getting a little thicker in here."" At 09:11, the crew advised PANOP that they were now going to Boston and that ""this smoke is getting too thick."" They also requested that emergency equipment be available when they arrived at Boston. During this conversation, the comment was made that the ""cockpit's full back there."" During its return to Boston, the flight was given preferential air traffic control treatment, although it had not declared an emergency. After issuing appropriate descent clearances en route so that fuel could be burned off more rapidly at lower altitudes, at 09:26:30 Boston Center advised Boston Arrival Radar that the flight was at 2,000 feet.  At 09:29, Clipper 160 asked Boston Center for the flight's distance from Boston, and added, ""The DME's don't seem to be working."" The Center answered, ""You're passing abeam, Pease Air Force Base, right now, sir, and you're about 40 to 45 miles to the northwest of Boston."" The first communication between Clipper 160 and the arrival radar controller was at 09:31:21. The flight was cleared ""direct Boston, maintain 2,000."" The controller asked if the flight was declaring an emergency; the reply was ""negative on the emergency, and may we have runway 33 left?"" The controller approved the request, and the flight proceeded to Boston as cleared. At approximately the same time, the captain instructed the crew to ""shut down everything you don't need."" At 09:34:20, the controller asked, ""Clipper 160, what do you show for a compass heading right now?"" Clipper 160 answered, ""Compass heading at this time is 205."" The controller then asked, ""will you accept a vector for a visual approach to a 5-mile final for runway 33 left, or do you want to be extended out further?"" The crew replied, ""Negative, we want to get it on the ground as soon as possible."" At 09:35:46, the controller stated, ""Clipper 160, advise anytime you have the airport in sight."" Clipper 160 did not reply. At 09:37:04, the arrival controller made the following transmission: ""Clipper 160, this is Boston approach control. If you read, squawk ident on any transponder. I see your transponder just became inoperative. Continue inbound now for runway 33 left, you're No. 1. There is a Lufthansa 747 on a 3-mile final for runway 27, the spacing is good. Remain on this frequency, Clipper 160."" There was no reply from the flight.  With flaps and spoilers had been extended for speed reduction, the airplane approached runway 33L. The yaw damper was rendered inoperative by the uncoordinated execution of emergency procedures earlier. This made the 707 extremely difficult to control at low speeds. Control was lost and the airplane struck the ground nose down about 262 feet from the right edge of the approach end of runway 33.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The presence of smoke in the cockpit which was continuously generated and uncontrollable. The smoke led to an emergency situation that culminated in loss of control of the aircraft during final approach, when the crew in uncoordinated action deactivated the yaw damper in conjunction with incompatible positioning of flight spoilers and wing flaps.  The NTSB further determines that the dense smoke in the cockpit seriously impaired the flight crew's vision and ability to function effectively during the emergency. Although the source of the smoke could not be established conclusively, the NTSB believes that the spontaneous chemical reaction between leaking acid, improperly packaged and stowed, and the improper sawdust packing surrounding the acid's package initiated the accident sequence.  A contributing factor was the general lack of compliance with existing regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials which resulted from the complexity of the regulations, the industry wide lack of familiarity with the regulations and the working level, the over-lapping jurisdictions, and the inadequacy of government surveillance."""

The Boeing 727 took off from runway 17 at 10:03 for the first leg to Tulcán. The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of FL180 and proceeded on the G-675 airway towards Ipiales from where it was to turn to Tulcán. At 10:15 the flight contacted Tulcán Tower. At that moment the airplane was 29 miles from the Tulcán NDB. The crew received permission to descend to FL140 and was given the current weather information, which included 8000 metres visibility, few clouds at 200 metres and overcast at 500 metres. The approach procedure called for a speed of 180 kts, but the actual speed was much higher at 230 knots. During the descent the airplane flew into the side of the Nevado el Cumbal Volcano at 14,700 feet, 1400 feet below the summit.  PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): 1) The decision of the instructor captain and his crew to initiate and continue the operation towards Tulcan airport below the meteorological minima established in the company's SOPs.  2) Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot flying and directed by the instructor captain, consisting of entering the holding pattern of the Tulcan radio beacon with a speed of 230 knots indicated airspeed and with a banking of 15 degrees exceeding the maximum stipulated speed limit of 180 knots  during the entire procedure including the holding pattern and using a banking below the recommended range of 25 to 30 degrees, thus exceeding the lateral navigation and obstacle protection limits of the holding pattern, leading this operation to the collision with El Cumbal Hill."

Ordaz Airport (PVR/MMPR),"Mexicana Flight 940 took off from Mexico City (MEX) at 08:40 for a flight to Puerto Vallarta (PVR), Mazatlán (MZT) and Los Angeles (LAX). The left main gear brake was overheated during the takeoff run. When the aircraft had reached FL310 the heat caused a tyre on the left hand main gear to explode. Fuel and hydraulic lines were ruptured and electrical cables severed resulting in a cabin decompression. An emergency was declared, but spilt fuel ignited and caused a massive fire on board. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed into a mountain in the Sierra Madre, at an elevation of 9000 feet. It was found that the tire had been serviced with air rather than nitrogen. The air, under high temperature and pressure, resulted in a chemical reaction with the tire itself. This led to a chemical explosion of the tire.  Probable Cause:  Failure in the brake system caused the number one assembly to drag, generating high temperatures that, when transmitted to the hub (wheel) and the air enclosed in the tires, resulted in the explosion of tire number one, fragmenting hub number two, breaking the fuel line that supplied engine number one and hydraulic lines, causing an intense fire that destroyed the lower rear part of the fuselage, weakening the lower structure, leading to the detachment of the tail unit and consequently the loss of control of the aircraft."

The aircraft was bound for Rome-Fiumicino Airport with a planned stop at Cagliari on the southern part of the island of Sardinia. The first officer contacted the controller at Cagliari at 00:23, asking for a weather report. The controller replied that runway 14 was in use, a wind from 190° at 8 knots, and a visibility of 7 km. He also stated there were thunderstorms without precipitation, south-east and south-west of the airport. After contacting the Cagliari Tower controller at 00:26, the flight was cleared to descend to the transition altitude of 6000 feet. Having in front of them a consistent formation of Cumulonimbus clouds, the first officer radioed their intention to make a 360° turn to further lower the altitude and thus avoid the cloud formations. The controller, not having traffic in the area, authorized the manoeuvre, and first officer then announced the intention to leave at 7500 feet for 3000 feet. The controller then asked the flight if they had visual contact with the ground, but this was not the case. The clearance was amended to go down to 6000 feet instead of 3000 feet.  Art 00:30 the flight reported that it was in visual contact with the ground, and that it was about to leave 6000 ft for 3000 ft. The controller confirmed this, adding that it had started to rain at the airport in the meantime. The aircraft however did not complete the planned 360° turn, thus finding itself with a different heading from that initially planned. After reaching 3000 feet, the flight was cleared for the approach. The first officer confirmed this and announced that they would start the final approach with a slight deviation to the right of the beacon. At 00:34 the first officer asked the controller to confirm that the ILS system was inoperative, which it was. At this stage of the flight the crew became unaware of their position. The captain believed he was flying over the sea, further south than the actual position of the aircraft, while the first officer rightly believed he was flying over the mountainous terrain of southern Sardinia. In the last minute and a half of the flight, the captain asked the first officer to lower the undercarriage and continued the descent. At an altitude of 2000 feet (610 m) the DC-9 hit the rocky mountainside of Conca d'Oru with the lower part of the fuselage, causing the aircraft to break up. A fire erupted. The point of impact was 18 km south-west of the airport."

The flight carried Mozambique president Samora Machel who had attended a meeting of African leaders in Zambia. While approaching Maputo, an inadvertent selection of the MATSAPA VOR frequency caused the crew to execute a premature 37-degrees turn. Although the pilot queried the turn, no effort was made to verify it by using the available navigational aids. The aircraft descended below the 3000 feet limit in spite of not having visual contact with Maputo. The crew erroneously assumed a power failure at Maputo. A 32-second GPWS warning was ignored and the aircraft collided with the ground at 2187 feet, bounced and crashed into an uphill slope. The aircraft broke up, slid across the South African/Eswatini border and caught fire. Machel, along with 33 other occupants did not survive the accident.  CAUSE: ""The cause of the accident was that the flight crew failed to follow procedural requirements for an instrument let-down approach , but continued to descend under visual flight rules in darkness and some cloud, i.e. without having visual contact with the ground, below minimum safe altitude, and in addition the ignored GPWS alarm."""

	   Russia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Ekaterinburg-Koltsovo Airport (SVX/USSS),Irkutsk Airport (IKT/UIII),"Vladivostokavia Flight 352 operated on a flight from Ekaterinburg to Vladivostok with an intermediate stop at Irkutsk. The flight departed Ekaterinburg at 19:47 local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of 10,100 m. Some three hours after takeoff, at 01:50 local time, descent was initiated. The descent and approach into Irkutsk was flown by the first officer.  At 02:05 the crew reported at 2100 m, runway in sight. The airplane still had an airspeed of 540 km/h. The maximum speed at which the landing gear may be lowered was 400 km/h. At 02:06:56 the airplane level off at 900 m, the airspeed still being about 420 km/h. The first officer ordered the gear down and the speed further decreased to 395 km/h with engines at idle. When the gear was down and locked the airplane entered a left hand turn with a 20-23 degree bank. The airspeed further decreased to 365 km/h where the recommended speed was 370 km/h in this stage of the flight. Power was added slowly. This was only just sufficient for maintaining an altitude of 850 m at 355-360 km/h. At 02:07:46, while still in the left hand turn, the angle of attack increased to 16,5° because the autopilot attempted to maintain altitude with a decreasing speed. An aural warning then sounded, indicating a high angle of attack. The first officer attempted to correct this and by using the control column, he disconnected the autopilot. Because he deflected the control column to the left, the left bank increased trough the maximum permissible value of -30° to -44°, and then to -48°. With the nose pitched down the speed increased to 400 m.  The airplane entered a layer of clouds, so the crew did not have a possibility of observing of the natural horizon and the landmarks under these conditions at night.  The captain intervened and attempted to control the airplane. He alternately deflecting the steering wheel to the left and right. An intensive deflection of steering control to the right, caused a positive angular acceleration of +4,4°/sec2. The captain reacted by deflecting the steering wheel to the left again. The first officer now realizes that the airplane is in a severe left bank (-45°) and indicates that they should be rolling to the right.  Because of an increase in vertical descent rate (20 m/sec), one of the crew members pulled the control column. The airplane pitched up rapidly, entered a stall and a subsequent flat spin. The crew were unable to regain control. After spinning for 22 seconds, the aircraft slammed down on its belly, broke up and burned.  The cause of the accident were the erroneous actions of the crew: When approaching the landing, the crew could not maintain the altitude mode of 850 meters when the aircraft was in the left turn at a speed less than recommended, which caused the autopilot to deflect the elevator to the height to fly, which increased the angle of attack. With a 45° left bank the second pilot pulled the steering wheel toward him. As a result, the angle of attack increased. At a large angle of attack, much more thrust is required than the one used by the crew. As a result, the aircraft reached the overcritical angles of attack and began to lose the lift of the wing. The abnormal situation continued to develop, after 10 seconds of delay with increasing engine thrust, controllability was lost. Incorrect actions of the commander of the crew (instinctive, contrary to instructions) only aggravated the situation and as a result the plane crashed."

It appeared that the crew had initiated the let-down procedure after one of the ADF needles swung. The other needle remained steady, but the crew assumed that they were over the beacon when the aircraft was still about 30 NM North of the beacon.

At 06:08 in the morning the crew were cleared to taxi to runway 24 for departure. At 06:12 the aircraft had lined up on the runway and was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was to be performed by the co-pilot. During the takeoff run the captain made the routine 'eighty knots' call and 12 seconds later a 'thump' or 'thud' was heard. The captain immediately ordered 'stop', closed the throttles an selected reverse thrust. The maximum speed achieved was 126 knots IAS. At first the captain thought they had suffered a tyre burst or a bird strike. The co-pilot had applied maximum wheel braking, however, because of the possible tyre burst, the captain said 'Don't hammer the brakes, don't hammer the brakes'. At 45 seconds after the start of the takeoff run, 9 seconds after the 'thud', as the aircraft decelerated trough 85 knots the captain radioed ATC that they were abandoning takeoff. The fire bell rang simultaneously and he added as he cancelled reverse thrust, 'it looks as though we've got a fire on number 1'. ATC confirmed this: 'right there's a lot of fire, they're on their way now.'. At 25 seconds past the 'thud' (and 20 seconds before the aircraft stopped) the crew decided to evacuate via the starboard side. The 737 was decelerating through 36 knots then and the captain warned the cabin crew about the evacuation six seconds later. After the aircraft stopped a no. 1 engine fire drill was carried out, the no. 2 engine was shut down and the passenger evacuation drill carried out. Before completion of this drill the captain saw fuel and fire spreading forward on the left side of the aircraft. Both flight crew members escaped through the sliding window in the right hand side.  Immediately after the 'thud' an intense fire developed on the left-hand side of the plane, causing some cracking and melting of windows with some associated smoke in the aft cabin. This caused some passengers to stand up in alarm and move into the aisle. Immediately after coming to a halt the purser tried to open the right front door (R1) but the escape slide container jammed on the doorframe, preventing further movement of the door. He then crossed to the L1 door and opened it (25 seconds had passed since the aircraft had stopped). The purser then returned to the R1 door and managed to clear the obstruction and was able to open the door 85 seconds after the aircraft had stopped. Meanwhile passengers had managed to open the right hand overwing exit. The R2 (right rear) door had also been opened but no one escaped through this exit. In total 17 surviving passengers escaped through the L1 door, 34 through R1 and 27 through the overwing exit.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The cause of the accident was an uncontained failure of the left engine, initiated by a failure of the No 9 combustor can which had been the subject of a repair. A section of the combustor can, which was ejected forcibly from the engine, struck and fractured an underwing fuel tank access panel. The fire which resulted developed catastrophically, primarily because of adverse orientation of the parked aircraft relative to the wind, even though the wind was light. Major contributory factors were the vulnerability of the wing tank access panels to impact, a lack of any effective provision for fighting major fires inside the aircraft cabin, the vulnerability of the aircraft hull to external fire and the extremely toxic nature of the emissions from the burning interior materials. The major cause of the fatalities was rapid incapacitation due to the inhalation of the dense toxic/irritant smoke atmosphere within the cabin, aggravated by evacuation delays caused by a forward right door malfunction and restricted access to the exits.

At 16:25 CDT, Flight 797 left Dallas and climbed to FL330. Except for a deviation to the south of their filed flight plan route to avoid weather, the flight progressed without incident until it entered the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center's (ARTCC) airspace. At 18:51:14 EDT, the three circuit breakers associated with the aft lavatory's flush motor and located on a panel on the cockpit wall behind the captain's seat, tripped in rapid succession. After identifying the circuit breakers, the captain immediately made one attempt to reset them; the circuit breakers would not reset. The captain assumed that the flush motor had probably seized and took no further action at this time. About 18:59:58, the captain again unsuccessfully tried to reset the three circuit breakers. He told the first officer that the circuit breaker ""Pops as I push it."" About 19:00, a passenger seated in the last row asked a flight attendant to identify a strange odor. The flight attendant thought the odor was coming from the aft lavatory. She took a CO2 fire extinguisher from the cabin wall and opened the lavatory door a few inches. She saw that a light gray smoke had filled the lavatory from the floor to the ceiling, but she saw no flames. While she was inspecting the lavatory, she inhaled some smoke and closed the door. The No.3 flight attendant then saw the No.2 flight attendant nearby and asked her to tell the flight attendant in charge of the situation. Upon being advised there was a fire, the flight attendant in charge instructed the No. 2 flight attendant to inform the captain and then to assist the No. 3 flight attendant in moving the passengers forward and in opening the eyebrow air vents over the passenger seats to direct air to the rear of the cabin. The flight attendant in charge then took the CO extinguisher and opened the lavatory door about three-quarters open. He also saw no flames, but he observed thick curls of black smoke coming out of the seams of the aft lavatory walls at the top of the wash basin behind the vanity and at the ceiling. He then proceeded ""to saturate the washroom with CO'' by spraying the paneling and the seam from which smoke was seeping and spraying the door of the trash bin. He then closed the lavatory door. At 19:02:40, the No. 2 flight attendant reached the cockpit and told the captain, ""Excuse me, there's a fire in the washroom in the back, they're just ... went back to go to put it out."" Upon being notified of the fire, the captain ordered the first officer to inspect the lavatory. The captain then donned his oxygen mask and selected the 100-percent oxygen position on his regulator. The first officer left the cockpit but did not take either smoke goggles or a portable oxygen bottle with him. (The airplane was not equipped with nor was it required to be equipped with self-contained breathing equipment or a full face smoke mask.) The first officer said that he could not get to the aft lavatory because the smoke, which had migrated over the last three to four rows of seats, was too thick. The flight attendant in charge told the first officer what he had seen when he opened the lavatory door, that he had discharged the CO2 extinguisher into the lavatory, and that he had not been able to see the source of the smoke before closing the door. He told the first officer, however, that he did not believe the fire was in the lavatory's trash container. The first officer told the flight attendant in charge that he was going forward to get smoke goggles. At 19:04:07, the first officer returned to the cockpit and told the captain that the smoke had prevented him from entering the aft lavatory and that he thought ""we'd better go down."" He did not tell the captain that the flight attendant in charge had told him that the fire was not in the trash bin. However, at 19:04:16, before the captain could respond, the flight attendant in charge came to the cockpit and told the captain that the passengers had been moved forward and that the captain didn't ""have to worry, I think its gonna be easing up."" The first officer looked back into the cabin and said that it was almost clear in the back. He told the captain, ""it's starting to clear now,"" and that he would go aft again if the captain wanted him to do so. According to the captain, the first officer's smoke goggles were stored in a bin on the right side of the cockpit and were not easily accessible to the first officer while he was not in his seat. Since the first officer needed the goggles and since there was a hurry, the captain gave him his goggles and, at 19:04:46, directed him to go aft. Two minutes later, while the first officer was out of the cockpit, the flight attendant in charge told the captain again that the smoke was clearing. The captain believed the fire was in the lavatory trash bin and decided not to descend at this time because he ""expected it (the fire) to be put out."" About 19:05:35, while the first officer was still aft to inspect the aft lavatory, the airplane experienced a series of electrical malfunctions. The master caution light illuminated, indicating that the airplane's left a.c. and d.c. electrical systems had lost power. In the meanwhile, the first officer proceeded to the aft lavatory and put on the smoke goggles. The lavatory door felt hot to the touch, so he decided not to open it and instructed the cabin crew to leave it closed. At that time, he noticed a flight attendant signaling him to hurry back to the cockpit. The first officer returned to the cockpit and got into his seat, and at 19:07:11, he told the captain, ""I don't like what's happening, I think we better go down, okay?"" Then the master warning light illuminated and the annunciator lights indicated that the emergency a.c. and d.c. electrical buses had lost power. The captain's and first officer's attitude directional indicators tumbled. The captain ordered the first officer to activate the emergency power switch, thereby directing battery power to the emergency a.c. and d.c. buses. The attitude directional indicators' gyros began erecting, however, because of the loss of a.c. power, the stabilizer trim was inoperative and remained so during the rest of the flight. At 19:08:12, Flight 797 called the radar high sector controller at Indianapolis Center: ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday."" The Louisville radar high sector controller acknowledged the call, and at 19:08:47, the flight told the controller that it had a fire and was going down. The controller told the flight that it was 25 nautical miles from Cincinnati and asked ""can you possibly make Cincinnati."" The flight answered that it could make Cincinnati and then requested clearance; it was then cleared to descend to 5,000 feet. At 19:09:05, Flight 797 reported that it was leaving FL330. The flight then told the controller that it needed to be vectored toward Cincinnati, that it was declaring an emergency, and that it had changed its transponder code to 7700 -- the emergency code. However, the transponder was inoperative due to the power loss. The Louisville radar high sector controller directed the flight to turn to 060 degrees and told it that the Greater Cincinnati Airport was at ""twelve o'clock at twenty miles."" The Indianapolis Center's Lexington low altitude D (LEX-D) controller then called the approach controller at the Cincinnati Airport's Terminal Radar Control (TRACON) facility to alert him of an impending handoff in his southwest sector and later told the Cincinnati approach controller that he had ""an emergency for you, Air Canada seven nine seven."" The approach controller replied, ""Zero six six two, thirty-five thousand."" Zero six six two was the code assigned to Continental 383, a westbound flight at FL350. At 19:09:33, the LEX-D controller answered, ""Yeah, thirty-three right now, he's twenty-five southwest."" The approach controller replied, ""Radar contact, okay."" However, when the approach controller accepted the handoff of Flight 797, he had mistaken the radar beacon target of Continental Flight 383 as that of Flight 797. Shortly after he had accepted the handoff, the approach controller had notified the Cincinnati Airport tower local controller that he intended to land an Air Canada jet with an on board fire on runway 36. The tower's local controller alerted the airport fire station, and crash-fire-rescue (CFR) vehicles were dispatched and positioned for an emergency landing. The firefighters had also been advised that the airplane had electrical problems, that smoke was coming from the aft lavatory, and that there was smoke or fire in the rear of the airplane. At 19:10:01, almost coincident with the end of his message to the local controller, the LEX-D controller informed the approach controller of Flight 797's assigned 060° heading. At 19:10:25, Flight 797 contacted the Cincinnati approach controller, declared an emergency, and said that it was descending. The approach controller acknowledged and told the flight to plan for a runway 36 instrument landing system (ILS) approach and requested the flight to turn right to 090 degrees. He then realized the target he was observing was not responding and attempted unsuccessfully to assign a discrete transponder code to it in order to track it better. Thereafter, at 19:10:48, Flight 797 reported that it had a fire in its aft lavatory and that the cabin was filling with smoke. The controller asked the flight to ""say the type airplane, number of people on board, and amount of fuel (on board)."" The first officer answered that he would supply this data later because ""I don't have time now."" At 19:12:40, the approach controller called the Evansville/Nabb D controller on the landline to request assistance. Almost simultaneous with the call, he also observed an eastbound primary target and began to monitor it. At 19:12:44, the flight requested the cloud ceiling at the airport and the controller responded that the ceiling was ""two thousand five hundred scattered, measure(d) eight thousand feet overcast, visibility one two (12) miles with light rain."" The controller then decided that the eastbound target was Flight 797, and at 19:12:54, he requested the flight to ""say altitude."" Based on the target's position -- about 3 nmi east of runway 36's extended centerline and about 8 nmi south of its threshold -- and its reported altitude of 8,000 feet, that it was too high and too fast to land on runway 36. He decided to use runway 27L for landing, and used the primary target to monitor the flight and vector it toward the airport. At 19:13:38, after Flight 797 was unable to tell him its heading because its heading instruments were inoperative, the approach controller asked the flight to turn left. The controller said that this was an identification turn and that it was also designed to place the airplane closer to the airport. He then told the flight that this was a ""no gyro"" radar approach for runway two seven left ... If and cleared it to descend to 3,500 feet. He then told the flight that it was 12 nmi southeast of the Cincinnati Airport, cleared it to land on runway 27L, and informed it that the surface wind was 220 degrees at 4 knots. He informed the tower of the change of landing runways and the tower directed the fire department to position its vehicles along runway 27L. At 19:15:11, Flight 797 reported that it was level at 2,500 feet."" The approach controller vectored the flight to runway 27L, and at 19:15:58, told it that it was 12 nmi from the airport. The flight descended to 2,000 feet, and the controller continued to supply range calls. When the captain sighted the runway, he extended the landing gear. Since the horizontal stabilizer was inoperative, the captain extended the flaps and slats incrementally through the 0, 5, 15, 25, and 40-degree positions. He allowed his indicated airspeed to stabilize at each flap position as he slowed to approach speed. He flew the final approach at 140 KIAS and completed the landing. After touchdown, he made a maximum effort stop using extended spoilers and full brakes. Because of the loss of the left and right a.c. buses, the antiskid system was inoperative and the four main wheel tires blew out. The airplane was stopped just short of the intersection of taxiway J. After the captain completed the emergency engine shutdown checklist, both he and the first officer attempted to go back into the cabin and assist in the passenger evacuation, but were driven back by the smoke and heat. Thereafter, they exited the airplane through their respective cockpit sliding windows. After the airplane stopped, the left (L-1) and right (R-1) forward cabin doors, the left forward (L-2) overwing exit, and the right forward (R-2) and aft (R-3) overwing exits were opened, and the slides at the L-1 and R-1 doors were deployed and inflated. The 3 cabin attendants and 18 passengers used these 5 exits to evacuate the airplane. After the 18 passengers and 5 crewmembers left the airplane, the cabin interior burst into flames. Twenty-three passengers perished in the fire. Neither the passengers, crew, nor witnesses outside of the airplane saw flames inside the cabin before the survivors left the plane. The fuselage and passenger cabin were gutted before airport fire personnel could extinguish the fire.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A fire of undetermined origin, an underestimate of fire severity, and conflicting fire progress information provided to the captain. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the flight crew's delayed decision to institute an emergency descent."""

En route stops included Pago Pago, American Samoa, and Honolulu, Hawaii. Flight 806 departed Auckland at 20:14. It was cleared to Pago Pago on an IFR flight plan. At 23:11, Flight 806 contacted Pago Pago Approach Control and reported its position 160 miles south of the Pago Pago airport. Approach control responded, ""Clipper eight zero six, roger, and Pago weather, estimated ceiling one thousand six hundred broken, four thousand broken, the visibility - correction, one thousand overcast. The visibility one zero, light rain shower, temperature seven eight, wind three five zero degrees, one five, and altimeter's two nine eight five."" At 23:13, Pago Pago Approach Control cleared the flight to the Pago Pago VORTAC. Flight 806 reported leaving FL330 three minutes later and leaving FL200 at 23:24. Pago Pago Approach Control cleared the flight at 23:24: ""Clipper eight zero six, you're cleared-for the ILS DME runway five approach - via the two zero mile arc south-southwest. Report the arc, and leaving five thousand."" At 23:3, the flight requested the direction and velocity of the Pago Pago winds and was told that they were 360 degrees variable from 020 degrees at 10 to 15 knots. At 23:34, the flight reported out of 5,500 feet and that they had intercepted the 226 degree radial of the Pago Pago VOR. The approach controller responded, ""Eight oh six, right. Understand inbound on the localizer. Report about three out. No other reported traffic. Winds zero one zero degrees at one five gusting two zero."" At 23:38, approach control said, ""Clipper eight oh six, appears that we've had power failure at the airport. "" The first officer replied, ""Eight oh six, we're still getting your VOR, the ILS and the lights are showing."" Approach control then asked, ""See the runway lights?"" The flight responded, ""That's Charlie."" The approach controller then said, "" ...we have a bad rain shower here. I can't see them from my position here."" ""We're five DME now and they still look bright,"" the first officer responded. Approach Control replied, ""´kay, no other reported traffic. The wind is zero three zero degrees at two zero, gusting two five. Advise clear of the runway."" At 23:39:41, the flight replied, ""Eight zero six, wilco."" This was the last radio transmission from the flight. On the flight deck the windshield wipers were turned on and the flaps were set at the 50° position, which completed the checklists for landing. At 23:40:22, the first officer stated, ""You're a little high."" The radio altimeter warning tone then sounded twice and the first officer said ""You're at minimums."" He reported the field in sight and said that they were at 140 kts. At 23:40:42, the aircraft crashed into trees at an elevation of 113 feet, and about 3,865 feet short of the runway threshold. The first impact with the ground was about 236 feet farther along the crash path. The aircraft continued through the jungle vegetation, struck a 3-foot-high lava rock wall, and stopped about 3,090 feet from the runway threshold.  Of the 101 occupants of the aircraft, 9 passengers and 1 crewmember survived the crash and fire. One passenger died the next day; the crewmember and three passengers died 3 days after the accident. One passenger died of his injuries 9 days after the accident.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's late recognition, and failure to correct in a timely manner, an excessive descent rate which developed as a result of the aircraft's penetration through destabilizing wind changes. The winds consisted of horizontal and vertical components produced by a heavy rainstorm and influenced by uneven terrain close to the aircraft's approach path. The captain's recognition was hampered by restricted visibility, the illusory effects of a ""black hole"" approach, inadequate monitoring of flight instruments, and the failure of the crew to call out descent rate during the last 15 seconds of flight."""

When weather had improved, the flight took off from Prague.  While descending towards Schönefeld Airport, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 25L. The aircraft captured the glide slope at 13.5 km from the runway. The Runway Visual Range (RVR) was reported to be 900 meters visibility, and 1700 m at point A and 1000 m at point B of the runway. As the aircraft was descending for runway 25L, the air traffic controller radioed to all aircraft on frequency that runway 25R was closed. The radio operator of flight 892 wrongly understood this message as a clearance to land on runway 25R. He replied ""Got it, thank you, 25 right"". This error was not noted by other crew members of flight 892 because of their lack of proficiency in English. The flight crew disconnected the autopilot and began a manoeuvre to align with runway 25R. The distance between both runways was 460 m.

The airplane took 47 tons of fuel, bringing the takeoff weight to 189 tons, and the centre of gravity to 29,3% MAC, which was within the prescribed limits. During the eight-hour stopover the crew decided to rest in the aircraft instead of a hotel. As the aircraft started taxiing to the runway the flight engineer was heard saying that he would select the flaps at 30 degrees and slats at 14 degrees for takeoff. This however was not done. Prior to takeoff the position of the flaps was not verified by any of the crew members. Takeoff was thus commenced with flaps and slats retracted and the stabilizer trimmed at the takeoff position -4 degrees (corresponding to actual takeoff weight, CofG and flaps at 30°). At a speed of 210 km/h the pilot pulled on the control column to lift off the nose gear. At a calculated unstick speed of 265 km/h the angle of attack reached 9 degrees but the plane did not lift off the runway. Accelerating through 290 km/h the angle of attack of the aircraft reached 14,5 degrees, setting off the angle of attack warning on the flight deck. Some 1750 meters down the runway, the aft fuselage struck the runway. Seventy meters further on, at a speed of 300 km/h and an angle of attack of 19,4°, the Ilyushin lifted off the runway. The air traffic controller who witnessed the departure advised the crew to abort the takeoff, but the captain apparently continued. The airplane rolled to the left until the wing contacted the runway. Then the flight engineer noted his error and, without informing the captain, began extending the flaps and slats. Again without informing the captain, the flight engineer brought back the power levers of the four engines to idle. After three seconds he moved them from idle to the 'engine shutdown' position. The captain three times yelled ""takeoff"" but the engines were already shut down. After flying for 490 meters the aircraft struck the ground and crashed."

The Tu-154M climbed to the cruise altitude of 35,100 feet (10.700 m). Because of storm cells ahead, the pilot decided to change course laterally by 20 km and attempted to climb over the storm cells. However, the thunderstorm front was unusually high, extending up to 15 km (49,000 feet). The Tu-154 entered an area of severe turbulence, pushing up the airplane from 11.961 m to 12.794 m within just 10 seconds. The angle of attack increased to 46 degrees and the airspeed dropped to zero. It entered a deep stall from which the crew could not recover. The plane crashed and burned in a field.  The cause of the crash was the loss of control in the manual flight mode with supercritical angles of attack, causing a stall with the subsequent transition to a flat spin and collision with the ground with a large vertical velocity. Factors were considered poor crew coordination, and failure to follow the instructions in the Aeroplane Flight Manual to prevent a stall. Also, the crew training methods used were insufficient to demonstrate the dangers of manual flight at high altitudes."

The captain of PanAm flight 110 who witnessed the event, said the aircraft then rolled to the left into a steep descent. The Boeing 707 disintegrated and crashed into the sea. It was determined that the detonation of an explosive device in the aft cargo compartment buckled and damaged the cabin floor in such a manner that one or more of the elevator and rudder system control cables was stretched and, perhaps, broken. The resultant displacement of control surfaces caused a violent pitch up and yaw and made the aircraft uncontrollable.

The flight departed Caracas at 12:05 local time. The first legs of the flight were uneventful. It took off from Maracaibo at 15:58 for the twenty-minute leg to Santa Bárbara del Zulia. The cruising altitude of FL165 was reached at 16:04. The controller at Santa Bárbara del Zulia cleared the flight to descend to 5500 feet, which was confirmed by the crew. The crew then asked if the VOR/DME at the airport was inoperative, which was denied by the air traffic controller. About 16:15 the descent was arrested. The captain had noticed an erroneous heading selection on the instruments and concluded that they were off course. A climbing right hand turn was flown. The GPWS sounded and a few seconds later, the airplane flew into the side of a fog-shrouded mountain in the La Aguada sector of the páramo Los Torres. Accident elevation was 9912 feet.  PROBABLE CAUSAL FACTORS (translated from original Spanish report): Collision with mountainous terrain while performing a flight in instrument meteorological conditions under visual flight rules (VFR into IMC) following wrong selection of heading or departure radial which the aircraft followed on its way to the destination airport.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1. The wrong selection of the departure heading from the Maracaibo Airport; the crew selected a course of 153 instead of 193. 2. Lack of supervision of the pilot in command, contributing to flight acts of indiscipline manifested by the following facts: A) For the modification of flight rules going from visual meteorological conditions (VMC) to instrument flight meteorological conditions (IMC) without appropriate assessment of the geographical position where he was flying. B) Distraction in the cockpit, the result of the conversation between the captain in command of the aircraft and a third person who was there, a male with aeronautical knowledge specific to a pilot. This situation allowed the error in departure radial selection or error or heading to the airport of destination to go unnoticed while performing the checklist called ""Taxi Checklist"" . C) Also influenced by the act of indiscipline, was the fact that an aircraft ADF frequency was tuned to a commercial station throughout the flight, broadcasting a musical program. 3. Unfavourable weather conditions on the flight, present on site at the time of the incident were crucial in its occurrence. 4. The total lack of interaction between the crew (crew coordination)."

The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at Mitú, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control. After flying over the control tower at Mitú, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at Mitú that they would proceed to Bogotá. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/ The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated. The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared. The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected. Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land.  During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed.  PROBABLE CAUSE FIRST IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT IN MITU. Low situational alert by the pilot in command in the final approach phase to land. SECOND IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE YOPAL. Failure of the crew to adequately plan for the foreseeable emergency.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Passive attitude of the crew, especially by the Commander of the aircraft in handling critical situations. Inappropriate handling of CRM, poor or inadequate communication in the cockpit. Little experience in flight hours as a commander by the pilot in command of the aircraft. Little experience inz total flight hours and in the equipment on the part of the co-pilot."

The Tu-134A took off from Sverdlovsk at 14:33 hours Moscow Time. Descent was started at 15:31 hours and the flight crew decided to close the window blinds on the captain's side to carry out a blind landing for training purposes. The aircraft was positioned for an approach to runway 15 and the approach was flown above the glide slope, but within limits. At decision height the captain decided to continue the approach. Despite the fact that it was not allowed to carry out a blind landing on this flight, the copilot or engineer did not intervene. The aircraft crossed the runway centreline at a height of 10 meters and one second before landing, the blinds were opened by the engineer. But this time was too short for the pilot to transition from instrument to visual flight. The aircraft touched down hard, 132 m past the runway threshold at a vertical speed of 5 m/s. This translated to 4.8 g. The left wing collapsed and spilled fuel was ignited. The plane then rolled around the longitudinal axis at a distance of 214 m from the point of touch down.

There were 126 passengers and eight crew members on board. The airplane operated on a flight KGL348 from Surgut Airport (SGC) to Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME). Three passengers died and about 32 were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by fire. Initial reports indicate that the airplane had been towed to the main taxiway for engine startup. A short circuit occurred while the AC generators were connected to the aircraft's electrical system after start-up of the engines. A fire erupted in the rear, spreading quickly through the main cabin. The crew shut down the engines and initiated an evacuation.  The Interstate Aviation Committee reported that engines no. 1, 2 and 3 and the APU were not the source of the fire. The fire started in the rear of the aircraft in the area of frames 62-65.  The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding ten to twenty times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses. The unsynchronised operation of the generators can be attributed to: - Poor technical conditions of contacts TKS233DOD responsible for connecting the generators with the electrical busses, that were damaged by prolonged operation without maintenance. A contact normally open was welded and fractured insulation material moved between contacts that are normally closed. These abnormal contact positions led to the connection between #2 and #3 generators. - Differences in the schematic diagrams of generator 2 and generators 1 and 3. When the switch is moved from ""check"" to ""enable"" with no delay in the ""neutral"" position generator 2 is brought online without time delay which leads to increased wear of normally closed contacts in the TKS233DOD unit. - The specific design of the electrical systems to ensure power supply to each bus from either the APU or either engine integrated drive generator."

The DC-9 departed the gate on schedule at 18:10. The first officer was performing the duties of the flying pilot. The weather information provided to the flightcrew from USAir dispatch indicated that the conditions at Charlotte were similar to those encountered when the crew had departed there approximately one hour earlier. The only noted exception was the report of scattered thunderstorms in the area. Flight 1016 was airborne at 18:23 for the planned 35 minute flight. At 18:27, the captain of flight 1016 made initial contact with the Charlotte Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) controller and advised that the flight was at 12,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The controller replied ""USAir ten sixteen ... expect runway one eight right."" Shortly afterward the controller issued a clearance to the flightcrew to descend to 10,000 feet. At 18:29, the first officer commented ""there's more rain than I thought there was ... it's startin ...pretty good a minute ago ... now it's held up."" On their airborne weather radar the crew observed two cells, one located south and the second located east of the airport. The captain said ""looks like that's [rain] setting just off the edge of the airport."" One minute later, the captain contacted the controller and said ""We're showing uh little buildup here it uh looks like it's sitting on the radial, we'd like to go about five degrees to the left to the ..."" The controller replied ""How far ahead are you looking ten sixteen?"" The captain responded ""About fifteen miles."" The controller then replied ""I'm going to turn you before you get there I'm going to turn you at about five miles northbound."" The captain acknowledged the transmission, and, at 18:33, the controller directed the crew to turn the aircraft to a heading of three six zero. One minute later the flightcrew was issued a clearance to descend to 6,000 feet, and shortly thereafter contacted the Final Radar West controller. At 18:35 the Final Radar West controller transmitted ""USAir ten sixteen ... maintain four thousand runway one eight right.'' The captain acknowledged the radio transmission and then stated to the first officer ""approach brief."" The first officer responded ""visual back up ILS."" Following the first officer's response, the controller issued a clearance to flight 1016 to ""...turn ten degrees right descend and maintain two thousand three hundred vectors visual approach runway one eight right.'' At 18:36, the Final Radar West controller radioed flight 1016 and said ""I'll tell you what USAir ten sixteen they got some rain just south of the field might be a little bit coming off north just expect the ILS now amend your altitude maintain three thousand."" At 18:37, the controller instructed flight 1016 to ''turn right heading zero niner zero."" At 18:38, the controller said ""USAir ten sixteen turn right heading one seven zero four from SOPHE [the outer marker for runway 18R ILS] ... cross SOPHE at or above three thousand cleared ILS one eight right approach."" As they were maneuvering the airplane from the base leg of the visual approach to final, both crew members had visual contact with the airport. The captain then contacted Charlotte Tower. The controller said ""USAir ten sixteen ... runway one eight right cleared to land following an F-K one hundred short final, previous arrival reported a smooth ride all the way down the final."" The pilot of the Fokker 100 in front also reported a ""smooth ride"". About 18:36, a special weather observation was recorded, which included: ... measured [cloud] ceiling 4,500 feet broken, visibility 6 miles, thunderstorm, light rainshower, haze, the temperature was 88 degrees Fahrenheit, the dewpoint was 67 degrees Fahrenheit, the wind was from 110 degrees at 16 knots .... This information was not broadcast until 1843; thus, the crew of flight 1016 did not receive the new ATIS. At 18:40, the Tower controller said ""USAir ten sixteen the wind is showing one zero zero at one nine."" This was followed a short time later by the controller saying ""USAir ten sixteen wind now one one zero at two one."" Then the Tower controller radioed a wind shear warning ""windshear alert northeast boundary wind one nine zero at one three.'' On finals the DC-9 entered an area of rainfall and at 18:41:58, the first officer commented ""there's, ooh, ten knots right there."" This was followed by the captain saying ""OK, you're plus twenty [knots] ... take it around, go to the right."" A go around was initiated. The Tower controller noticed Flight 1016 going around ""USAir ten sixteen understand you're on the go sir, fly runway heading, climb and maintain three thousand."" The first officer initially rotated the airplane to the proper 15 degrees nose-up attitude during the missed approach. However, the thrust was set below the standard go-around EPR limit of 1.93, and the pitch attitude was reduced to 5 degrees nose down before the flightcrew recognized the dangerous situation. When the flaps were in transition from 40 to 15 degrees (about a 12-second cycle), the airplane encountered windshear. Although the DC-9 was equipped with an on-board windshear warning system, it did not activate for unknown reasons. The airplane stalled and impacted the ground at 18:42:35.  Investigation revealed that the headwind encountered by flight 1016 during the approach between 18:40:40 and 18:42:00 was between 10 and 20 knots. The initial wind component, a headwind, increased from approximately 30 knots at 18:42:00 to 35 knots at 18:42:15. The maximum calculated headwind occurred at 18:42:17, and was calculated at about 39 knots. The airplane struck the ground after transitioning from a headwind of approximately 35 knots, at 18:42:21, to a tailwind of 26 knots (a change of 61 knots), over a 14 second period.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""1) the flight crew's decision to continue an approach into severe convective activity that was conducive to a microburst; 2) the flight crew's failure to recognize a windshear situation in a timely manner; 3) the flight crew's failure to establish and maintain the proper airplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the windshear; and 4) the lack of real-time adverse weather and windshear hazard information dissemination from air traffic control, all of which led to an encounter with and failure to escape from a microburst-induced windshear that was produced by a rapidly developing thunderstorm located at the approach end of runway 18R.         Contributing to the accident were: 1) the lack of air traffic control procedures that would have required the controller to display and issue ASR-9 radar weather information to the pilots of flight 1016; 2) the Charlotte tower supervisor's failure to properly advise and ensure that all controllers were aware of and reporting the reduction in visibility and the RVR value information, and the low level windshear alerts that had occurred in multiple quadrants; 3) the inadequate remedial actions by USAir to ensure adherence to standard operating procedures; and 4) the inadequate software logic in the airplane's windshear warning system that did not provide an alert upon entry into the windshear."""

All 157 persons on board were killed. The aircraft operated a domestic flight from Benghazi to Tripoli, Libya. As the flight approached Tripoli Airport, it was instructed to hold at the Papa Echo beacon at 3000 feet, 4.1DME from runway 27. At 08:05 the flight was told they would need to hold for another three minutes due to military traffic. This military traffic was a MiG-23UB that had just taken off. The aircraft climbed in a left hand turn and headed towards Papa Echo. Reaching 3000 feet, the aircraft hit the tail fin of flight 1103. The tail separated and the Boeing 727 entered an uncontrollable descent and impacted the ground. Both crew members of the MiG-23 reportedly ejected safely."

At the same time Dragon Air Flight 203 (a Boeing 737 registered VR-HYL, carrying 62 occupants) also approached Phuket VOR/DME on radial 090. At 08:34 UTC Dragonair 203 reported at 2500 feet with Thai 365 in sight in front of them. The Thai Boeing was flying at 3000 feet at the time, and was 13 miles from Phuket VOR/DME. Dragonair 203, first priority in approach sequence, then turned right at 12 DME and was going to turn inbound for finals for runway 27. The Thai crew surmised that the other crew were making a false position report to gain landing priority and reported hurriedly that they were at 8 DME inbound and requested visual approach, though they hadn't reached 8 DME yet. This forced Phuket Approach to give Thai 365 landing priority at 08:35.  The Dragonair crew (flying IFR) immediately warned that the Thai plane couldn't descend through their flight level. Concentrating on the conflicting traffic the speed decayed to 163 knots until the stick shaker activated. The Thai crew then applied power and raised the landing gear, but the aircraft entered a stall crashed into the sea, disintegrating on impact.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot slowed the aircraft and it stalled while the pilot prepared to be number one on landing as advised by Phuket approach control. It appears that he was worrying and not sure whether he could make number one landing because the pilot if number two aircraft in sequence gave warning that the number one aircraft ahead was above him and could not descend passing through his level. The pilot added power and raised the gear after stick shaker activated but didn't execute a recovery before hitting the sea."""

Lusaka then cleared the aircraft to descend to 6000 feet (2221 feet above runway elevation) and moments later a clearance was given to make a visual approach for runway 10. At 09:32 flaps were selected to 50 degrees. Suddenly, at 09:33, the complete right-hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator assembly were seen to separate in flight. The aircraft pitched rapidly nose down and dived vertically into the ground from a height of about 800 feet. The main wreckage was located 3660 m from the runway threshold.  CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by a loss of pitch control following the in-flight separation of the right hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator as a result of a combination of metal fatigue and inadequate failsafe design in the rear spar structure. Shortcomings in design assessment, certification and inspection procedures were contributory factors."

All 144 on board were killed. The aircraft, a Boeing 727-231, departed Port Harcourt at 15:52. The trainee copilot was Pilot Flying, the captain was Pilot Monitoring on the flight to Lagos. It was cleared by Port Harcourt ATC to the cruising altitude of FL240. At 15:47 the flight established initial contact with Lagos Approach Control, and was assigned a transponder code. At 15:54 the flight reported crossing SEPER point. After this position report, the flight appeared not to be maintaining a listening watch, as it gave no reply to two consecutive calls from Approach Control, and then after some time replied to a transmission not meant for it At the same time a Triax Airlines Boeing 727 (Flight 185) had departed Lagos and was flying at FL160 towards Enugu. The Lagos controller had terminated contact with the Triax aircraft when the ADC crew requested to descend. The permission to descend was delayed to allow a corporate jet (5N-APN) to pass beneath the 727 at FL210.  At 15:59 Lagos Approach Control then cleared the flight to FL160 and subsequently requested the flight to contact Lagos Radar. The flight was identified by Lagos Radar 41 miles south-east of the airport, and instructed it to fly the heading of 320° to avoid Triax flight 185, and to descend to FL50. At 16:02.50 Lagos Radar instructed the aircraft two times in succession to maintain heading 300. The captain then took over control from the copilot by stating: ""I have it."" At 16:03.08 the flight reported: ""I have the traffic... and I continue my heading to 330 to avoid him"". This was the last transmission. The records of the FDR show that flight 086 was maintaining a steady coordinated turn towards heading 330 for the first 10 seconds of the last 50 seconds of the flight. After 15 seconds, the airplane was put in bank angle of 43.2 degrees. It maintained this configuration for 10 seconds before the bank angle increased to 68.8 degrees. This attitude was observed for 5.5 seconds before it was further increased to 83 degrees. The airplane must have suffered from high speed stall and gone into a roll with a nose down attitude.  The aircraft appeared to be recovering just before it impacted the lagoon water because it succeeded in reducing the vertical acceleration from 8.44 to 2.1 G and the bank angle to 61.6 degrees. But it did not have sufficient height to make a full recovery.  The aircraft crashed and disintegrated on impact.  IMMEDIATE CAUSE: ""The untidy traffic separation by the radar controller which resulted from the vectoring of ADK 086 towards the track of the opposite traffic TIX 185."" REMOTE CAUSE: ""The error of judgement by the pilot of ADK 096 to continue his turn to heading 330 M to avoid TIX 185 and his subsequent collision avoidance manoeuver constituted the remote causes of this accident."""

The airplane was configured for a takeoff weight of 174 tons with the stabilizer set at -3.3 degrees. The actual weight was probably around 182 tons, which was still within limits. The aircraft lifted off the runway at 263 kph after rolling for about 2800 metres. It subsequently climbed to 29 m at which altitude it leveled off for 4.5 seconds. After that the airplane began to descend gradually. Four seconds into descent, the commander ordered the retraction of flaps. By this time the aircraft was already descending at the rate of 3.5 m/sec and the speed was increasing. At the last moment they noted that the descent and suddenly initiated a climb. The airplane then contacted the water and crashed.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by aircraft colliding with the water surface shortly after take off. While the aircraft had gathered sufficient energy to sustain climb, the crew failed to monitor altitude and react correctly in the short time that the aircraft was airborne. This resulted in the aircraft going into descent till it reached an altitude where recovery was not possible. The possibility of crew fatigue as a contributory factor in this accident cannot be ruled out."""

	   Uruguay",En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"Posadas Airport, MI (PSS/SARP)","Buenos Aires-Jorge Newbery Airport, BA (AEP/SABE)","Austral flight 2553 took off from Posadas, Argentina at 21:18 for a domestic flight to Buenos Aires-Aeroparque. Before departure there was no specific warning for weather conditions to be encountered during the flight. En route at FL350 the aircraft encountered bad weather with Cumulonimbus clouds (reportedly topping at 49000 feet), an outside air temperature of -59°C and windshear conditions with winds at 80 km/h. The aircraft deviated from the airway and entered the Montevideo Flight Information Region (FIR) without contacting the Montevideo controller. At 22:04 the aircraft entered an area with icing conditions. Three minutes later the first officer, who was pilot flying, initiated a descent without prior permission. Meanwhile the captain contacted Ezeiza Control, requesting permission to descend. Ezeiza Control radioed that the flight was over Uruguay territory and that they needed to contact Montevideo Control for permission. During the descent the first officer complained that his airspeed indicator did not seem to be working correctly.  Descending through FL300, the first officer extended the slats. The pilots were trained to extend slats when recovering from approach to stall situations at 10-12 000 feet. However, the actual airspeed at the time of extension was higher than permitted. This exceeded the design limit, causing an asymmetry. The pilots lost control of the plane which then entered an uncontrolled descent, crashing in a swampland on the banks of the Uruguay River. The wreckage was found at 04:40 the next morning in a 25 feet deep, 80 feet wide crater.  Anomalous airspeed indications preceded the slat extension (a sudden increase from 200 knots to 450 knots IAS in 4 seconds), possibly due to icing of the pitot tubes.  PROBABLE CAUSES: (translated from original Spanish report) IMMEDIATE CAUSE: ""The Accident Investigation Committee Aviation of the Republic of Uruguay, determined that the immediate cause of the accident was likely that at a pressure altitude of 30,000 ft, the first officer, who was in charge of the controls, found himself in a flight condition which induced him to extend the slats. He did this at a speed much higher than the limit of the structural design of the slats and by extension damage occurred, causing an asymmetry, with consequent loss of control fro which he was unable to recover. The co-pilot's interpretation as to the need to extend the slats would have been a result of erroneous indications of low speed (IAS), caused by blockage of the pitot tubes which resulted from atmospheric icing. It was not possible to determine if the obstruction was caused by the crew by not activating the heating system via the selector switch, or failure of that system. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: a) No indication of Mach No. on the speed indicators installed in the accident aircraft within its flight envelope, with air speeds below 250 KIAS. b) Lack of training of the pilots in flight instrument failures and upset recovery.  c) Lack of training of the pilots in the recovery of approach to stall in the DC-9 aircraft in ""clean configuration"" in accordance with the procedures specified in the FCOM, section 5, 10-0-0, code 30. d) Lack of instruction and pilot training in crew resource management (CRM). e) Absence of a warning light PITOT/STALL-HEATER OFF on the annunciator panel of the aircraft. f) Deficiency in procedures for operational flight dispatch."

Weather at the destination was poor with a visibility of 1200 m, haze, drizzle, and an overcast at 110 m. The aircraft deviated from the approach procedures and at a distance of 8600 m from the runway the aircraft was at 500 m (instead of 400 m as prescribed) with a lateral deviation of 1900 m to the right at a speed of 390 km/h with flaps and stabilizer not yet configured for final approach. None of the crew members reported the altitude and speed to the commander and the navigator had not given any information to allow the aircraft to align with the runway and glide path. The navigator then suggested the captain to select flaps to 20° and to make a turn to align with the runway. The captain ignored this and continued his approach with performing the necessary actions. While descending through a height of 350 m the GPWS sounded. The flight crew did not react to this warning. At a distance of 4500 m from the runway, the aircraft had a 200300 m lateral deviation from the approach path and had reached a height of 200 m. To reach the landing course, the commander began to turn to the right with a roll of up to 35°. The turn was performed uncoordinated, with the result that the vertical speed increased to 15-16 m/s. The approach continued to be unstabilized and at an altitude of about 80 m the navigator made a last attempt to convince the aircraft commander of the need for a go-around. Two seconds later the captain likely saw trees ahead and attempted a manouvre to avoid a collision. The aircraft struck trees 2962 m from the runway at a speed of 370 km/h and a rate of descent of 6 m/s. At that moment, the plane was 60 meters to the left of the extended runway centreline.

The aircraft operated on a passenger service from Yerevan-Erebuni Airport to Stepanakert Airport. In addition to 30 passengers with tickets, the crew took on board 13 unregistered passengers. With this heavy load, the captain requested a lower altitude, 4500 m, for the flight. This was granted by ATC, while the regular altitude on the route was 5100-6600 m with a minimum safe height of 4516 m. At 09:59, at a distance of 21 km after passing the Azizbekov NDB, the crew was taken over by a controller of Kafan Airport. The controller instructed to keep the height of 4500 meters to the point of descent. The flight was the cleared down to 3900 m and the aircraft descended over mountains covered by a cloud deck with an upper boundary of 3000-3300 m. However, the flight crew never reported their exact position and the controller did not check it on radar. The flight reached the altitude of 3900 m at 10:07, and continued descending without informing the controller. At 10:08, the captain requested to contact Stepanakert, while giving a false report that the flight altitude was 3900 m.  Not observing the aircraft, not knowing its actual flight altitude and not having direct communication with the controller at Stepanakert, the Kafan ATC controller allowed the crew to switch to the Stepanakert frequency.  The captain reported to the controller that they were at an altitude of 3900 m and requested permission to descend to 2400 m. The controller at Stepanakert, having no radar facilities to monitor the aircraft, permitted a descent to 3000 m the NDB. At 10:09:57, the aircraft collided with a rocky mountain slope at an altitude of 2,520 m while descending in clouds.  Conclusion: The catastrophe was caused by a combination of the following factors: 1) The captain's violations of the flight rules set forth in the policy documents manifested in unsatisfactory navigation, straightening the route and premature unauthorized descent to a height below the minimum safety altitude, which resulted in a collision with a mountain. 2) Violations of ATC rules in their zones by ATC dispatchers of Erebuni, Kafan and Stepanakert airports, expressed in failure to comply with the rules of air traffic control and non-interference in the actions of the crew who violated the rules of navigation and flight regime, which did not allow timely prevention of the aircraft collision with an obstacle. The dispatchers at Yerevan-Stepanakert have a stereotype of work: to allow those conditions of approach, which the crews requested. These violations became possible due to shortcomings in the organization of flight work, flights and air traffic control at the Yerevan-Stepanakert MVL of the Armenian and Azerbaijani State Administration."

The plane was carrying about 21 tons of cargo, mostly woolen carpet, when it crashed. Weather at the time was drizzly conditions with ground temperature of 22°C.  PROBABLE CAUSE: The accident occurred as the crew after take off did not adhere to the published Standard Instrument Departure (SID) procedure for runway 20 at Kathmandu, Nepal. Contributory factors:  - incomplete departure briefing given by P1 while other cockpit activities were in progress;  - the unexpected airspeed decay to V 2 -3 during initial right climbing turn South of the VOR which occurred while P2 was busy with ATC;  - the improper power and climb profile used by P1 after rolling the aircraft out on a Southwest heading following the initial airspeed loss;  - the inadequate intra cockpit crew co-ordination and communication as the aircraft proceeded to and across the KTM VOR 4DME arc before recommencing a shallow right turn and the incorrect; and  - slow response to the initial and subsequent GPWS activation prior to the collision with the terrain."

The crew flew three uneventful roundtrip flights, one each from Honolulu to Hilo (ITO), Kahului Airport, HI (OGG) on the island of Maui, and Kauai Island Airport (LIH). At 11:00, a scheduled first officer change took place for the remainder of the day. The crew flew from Honolulu to Maui and then from Maui to Hilo. At 13:25, flight 243 departed Hilo Airport en route to Honolulu. The first officer conducted the takeoff and en route climb to FL240 in VMC. As the airplane leveled at 24,000 feet, both pilots heard a loud ""clap"" or ""whooshing"" sound followed by a wind noise behind them. The first officer's head was jerked backward, and she stated that debris, including pieces of gray insulation, was floating in the cockpit. The captain observed that the cockpit entry door was missing and that ""there was blue sky where the first-class ceiling had been."" The captain immediately took over the controls of the airplane. He described the airplane attitude as rolling slightly left and right and that the flight controls felt ""loose."" Because of the decompression, both pilots and the air traffic controller in the observer seat donned their oxygen masks. The captain began an emergency descent. He stated that he extended the speed brakes and descended at an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 280 to 290 knots. Because of ambient noise, the pilots initially used hand signals to communicate. The first officer stated that she observed a rate of descent of 4,100 feet per minute at some point during the emergency descent. The captain also stated that he actuated the passenger oxygen switch. The passenger oxygen manual tee handle was not actuated. When the decompression occurred, all the passengers were seated and the seat belt sign was illuminated. The No. 1 flight attendant reportedly was standing at seat row 5. According to passenger observations, the flight attendant was immediately swept out of the cabin through a hole in the left side of the fuselage. The No. 2 flight attendant, standing by row 15/16, was thrown to the floor and sustained minor bruises. She was subsequently able to crawl up and down the aisle to render assistance and calm the passengers. The No. 3 flight attendant, standing at row 2, was struck in the head by debris and thrown to the floor. She suffered serious injuries. The first officer tuned the transponder to emergency code 7700 and attempted to notify Honolulu Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) that the flight was diverting to Maui. Because of the cockpit noise level, she could not hear any radio transmissions, and she was not sure if the Honolulu ARTCC heard the communication. Although Honolulu ARTCC did not receive the first officer's initial communication, the controller working flight 243 observed an emergency code 7700 transponder return about 23 nautical miles south-southeast of the Kahalui Airport, Maui. Starting at 13:48:15, the controller attempted to communicate with the flight several times without success. When the airplane descended through 14,000 feet, the first officer switched the radio to the Maui Tower frequency. At 13:48:35, she informed the tower of the rapid decompression, declared an emergency, and stated the need for emergency equipment. The local controller instructed flight 243 to change to the Maui Sector transponder code to identify the flight and indicate to surrounding air traffic control (ATC) facilities that the flight was being handled by the Maui ATC facility. The first officer changed the transponder as requested. At 13:50:58, the local controller requested the flight to switch frequencies to approach control because the flight was outside radar coverage for the local controller. Although the request was acknowledged, Flight 243 continued to transmit on the local controller frequency. At 13:53:44, the first officer informed the local controller, ""We're going to need assistance. We cannot communicate with the flight attendants. We'll need assistance for the passengers when we land."" An ambulance request was not initiated as a result of this radio call. The captain stated that he began slowing the airplane as the flight approached 10,000 feet msl. He retracted the speed brakes, removed his oxygen mask, and began a gradual turn toward Maui's runway 02. At 210 knots IAS, the flightcrew could communicate verbally. Initially flaps 1 were selected, then flaps 5. When attempting to extend beyond flaps 5, the airplane became less controllable, and the captain decided to return to flaps 5 for the landing. Because the captain found the airplane becoming less controllable below 170 knots IAS, he elected to use 170 knots IAS for the approach and landing. Using the public address (PA) system and on-board interphone, the first officer attempted to communicate with the flight attendants; however, there was no response. At the command of the captain, the first officer lowered the landing gear at the normal point in the approach pattern. The main gear indicated down and locked; however, the nose gear position indicator light did not illuminate. Manual nose gear extension was selected and still the green indicator light did not illuminate; however, the red landing gear unsafe indicator light was not illuminated. After another manual attempt, the handle was placed down to complete the manual gear extension procedure. The captain said no attempt was made to use the nose gear downlock viewer because the center jumpseat was occupied and the captain believed it was urgent to land the airplane immediately. At 13:55:05, the first officer advised the tower, ""We won't have a nose gear,"" and at 13:56:14, the crew advised the tower, ""We'll need all the equipment you've got."" While advancing the power levers to maneuver for the approach, the captain sensed a yawing motion and determined that the No.1 (left) engine had failed. At 170 to 200 knots IAS, he placed the No. 1 engine start switch to the ""flight"" position in an attempt to start the engine; there was no response. A normal descent profile was established 4 miles out on the final approach. The captain said that the airplane was ""shaking a little, rocking slightly and felt springy."" Flight 243 landed on runway 02 at Maui's Kahului Airport at 13:58:45. The captain said that he was able to make a normal touchdown and landing rollout. He used the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and brakes to stop the airplane. During the latter part of the rollout, the flaps were extended to 40° as required for an evacuation. An emergency evacuation was then accomplished on the runway.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the Aloha Airlines maintenance program to detect the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage, which ultimately led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing to the accident were the failure of Aloha Airlines management to supervise properly its maintenance force as well as the failure of the FAA to evaluate properly the Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and quality control deficiencies. Also contributing to the accident were the failure of the FAA to require Airworthiness Directive 87-21-08 inspection of all the lap joints proposed by Boeing Alert Service Bulletin SB 737-53A1039 and the lack of a complete terminating action (neither generated by Boeing nor required by the FAA) after the discovery of early production difficulties in the 737 cold bond lap joint, which resulted in low bond durability, corrosion and premature fatigue cracking."""

Hartsfield International Airport, GA (ATL/KATL)","ValuJet Flight 592 was a scheduled flight from Miami (MIA) to Atlanta (ATL). The inbound flight had been delayed and arrived at Miami at 13:10. Flight 592 had been scheduled to depart at 13:00. The cruising altitude was to be flight level 350 with an estimated time en route of 1 hour 32 minutes. The DC-9 was loaded with 4,109 pounds of cargo (baggage, mail, and company-owned material (COMAT)). The COMAT consisted of two main tires and wheels, a nose tire and wheel, and five boxes that were described as ""Oxy Cannisters -Empty."" This cargo was loaded in the forward cargo compartment.  Flight 592 was pushed back from the gate shortly before 13:40. The DC-9 then taxied to runway 09L. At 14:03:24, ATC cleared the flight for takeoff and the flightcrew acknowledged the clearance. At 14:04:24, the flightcrew was instructed by ATC to contact the north departure controller. At 1404:32, the first officer made initial radio contact with the departure controller, advising that the airplane was climbing to 5,000 feet. Four seconds later, the departure controller advised flight 592 to climb and maintain 7,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged the transmission. At 14:07:22, the departure controller instructed flight 592 to ""turn left heading three zero zero join the WINCO transition climb and maintain one six thousand,"" which was acknowledged. At 14:10:03, the flight crew heard a sound, after which the captain remarked, ""What was that?"" At that moment, the airplane was at 10,634 feet msl, 260 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and both engine pressure ratios (EPRs) were 1.84. At 14:10:15, the captain stated, ""We got some electrical problem,"" followed 5 seconds later with, ""Were losing everything."" At 14:10:21, the departure controller advised flight 592 to contact Miami on frequency 132.45 mHz. At 14:10:22, the captain stated, ""We need, we need to go back to Miami,"" followed 3 seconds later by shouts in the background of ""fire, fire, fire, fire."" At 14:10:27, the CVR recorded a male voice saying, ""Were on fire, were on fire."" At 14:10:28, the controller again instructed flight 592 to contact Miami Center. At 14:10:31, the first officer radioed that the flight needed an immediate return to Miami. The controller replied, ""Critter five ninety two uh roger turn left heading two seven zero descend and maintain seven thousand."" The first officer acknowledged the heading and altitude. The peak altitude reached was 10,879 feet msl at 14:10:31, and about 10 seconds a wings-level descent started. Shouting in the cabin subsided. The controller then queried flight 592 about the nature of the problem. The captain stated ""fire"" and the first officer replied, ""uh smoke in the cockp... smoke in the cabin."" The controller responded, ""roger"" and instructed flight 592, when able, to turn left to a heading of two five zero and to descend and maintain 5,000 feet. At 14:11:12, a flight attendant was heard shouting, ""completely on fire."" The DC-9 began to change heading to a southerly direction and at 14:11:26, the north departure controller advised the controller at Miami Center that flight 592 was returning to Miami with an emergency. At 14:11:37, the first officer transmitted that they needed the closest available airport. At 1411:41, the controller replied, ""Critter five ninety two theyre gonna be standing (unintelligible) standing by for you, you can plan runway one two when able direct to Dolphin [a navaid] now."" At 14:11:46, the first officer responded that the flight needed radar vectors. At 14:11:49, the controller instructed flight 592 to turn left heading one four zero. The first officer acknowledged the transmission. At 14:12:45, the controller transmitted, ""Critter five ninety two keep the turn around heading uh one two zero."" There was no response from the flightcrew. The last recorded FDR data showed the airplane at 7,200 feet msl, at a speed of 260 KIAS, and on a heading of 218 degrees. At 14:12:48, the FDR stopped recording data. The airplanes radar transponder continued to function; thus, airplane position and altitude data were recorded by ATC after the FDR stopped. At 14:13:18, the departure controller instructed, ""Critter five ninety two you can uh turn left heading one zero zero and join the runway one two localizer at Miami."" Again there was no response. At 14:13:27, the controller instructed flight 592 to descend and maintain 3,000 feet. At 1413:37, an unintelligible transmission was intermingled with a transmission from another airplane. No further radio transmissions were received from flight 592. At 14:13:43, the departure controller advised flight 592, ""Opa Locka airports about 12 oclock at 15 miles."" The accident occurred at 14:13:42. Ground scars and wreckage scatter indicated that the airplane crashed into the Everglades in a right wing down, nose down attitude.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable causes of the accident, resulting in a fire in the Class D cargo compartment from the actuation of one or more oxygen generators improperly carried as cargo, were: (1) the failure of SabreTech to properly prepare, package, identify, and track unexpended chemical oxygen generators before presenting them to ValuJet for carriage; (2) the failure of ValuJet to properly oversee its contract maintenance program to ensure compliance with maintenance, maintenance training, and hazardous materials requirements and practices; and (3) the failure of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require smoke detection and fire suppression systems in Class D cargo compartments.  Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor ValuJet's heavy maintenance program and responsibilities, including ValuJet's oversight of its contractors, and SabreTech's repair station certificate; the failure of the FAA to adequately respond to prior chemical oxygen generator fires with programs to address the potential hazards; and the failure of ValuJet to ensure that both ValuJet and contract maintenance employees were aware of the carrier's no-carry hazardous materials policy and had received appropriate hazardous materials training.""

On December 25, UTA Flight 141 departed Conakry, Guinea for a scheduled flight to Beirut, Lebanon with a planned intermediate stop at Cotonou, Benin and a planned technical stop at Kufrah, Libya. The flight departed at 10:07 carrying 86 passengers and a crew of 10. It arrived at Cotonou at 12:25 were nine passengers disembarked. A total of 63 persons checked in at the airport check-in desk. Ten others boarded from an aircraft that had arrived from Lomé, Togo. Passenger boarding and baggage loading took place in a climate of great confusion. The airplane was full and it is thought that there were more passengers aboard the plane than had officially checked in. In the cockpit, two UTA executives were occupying the jump seats. Faced with the particularly large number and size of the hand baggage, the chief flight attendant informed the captain of the situation. Meanwhile the ground handling companys agents began loading the baggage in the aft hold when one of the operators agents asked them to continue loading in the forward hold, which already contained baggage. When the operation was finished, the hold was full. During this time, the crew prepared the airplane for the second flight segment. The co-pilot was discussing his concerns with the UTA executives, reminding them of the importance of determining the precise weight of the loading of the airplane. The captain determined the limitations for the flight and selected the following configuration: flaps 25°, air conditioning units shut down. At 13:47, the crew began the pre-flight checklist. Calm was restored in the cockpit. At 13:52, they were cleared to roll. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF). The elevator was set at 6 3/4, it was stated that the takeoff would be performed with full power applied with brakes on, followed by a climb at three degrees maximum to gain speed, with no turn after landing gear retraction. As the roll was beginning, a flight attendant informed the cockpit that passengers who wanted to sit near their friends were still standing and did not want to sit down. The airlines Director General called the people in the cabin to order. It was warm outside at a temperature of 32 deg. C with a light breeze as the flight received permission to takeoff from runway 24. Runway 06/24 is an asphalt runway, measuring 2400 (7874 feet) meters with a 55 m (180 feet) overrun zone.  At 13:58:01 the thrust levers were advanced. Fourteen seconds later the brakes were released and the 727 accelerated down the runway. Forty-six seconds after brake release the captain announced V1 and VR speeds. At that moment the aircraft was 1620 m down the runway at a speed of 137 kts. The copilot tried to rotate the plane, but seven seconds later, at a speed of 148 kts and 2100 m down the runway, the nose just slowly rose. The 727 barely climbed, causing the main undercarriage to strike localizer antennas. It then struck the roof of a 2-3 meters high small building housing radio equipment. The operator inside the building suffered injuries. The plane continued, smashed through the concrete airport boundary fence, crashed and broke up on the shoreline.  The exact number of occupants and fatalities could not be established with certainty. It is thought that 133 passengers died in the crash with an additional three people of which it was not possible to establish if they were passengers or passers-by on the beach. Most probably however, they were passengers.  CAUSES:  The accident resulted from a direct cause: - The difficulty that the flight crew encountered in performing the rotation with an overloaded airplane whose forward center of gravity was unknown to them;   and two structural causes: - The operators serious lack of competence, organization and regulatory documentation, which made it impossible for it both to organize the operation of the route correctly and to check the loading of the airplane; - The inadequacy of the supervision exercised by the Guinean civil aviation authorities and, previously, by the authorities in Swaziland, in the context of safety oversight.  The following factors could have contributed to the accident: - The need for air links with Beirut for the large communities of Lebanese origin in West Africa; - The dispersal of effective responsibility between the various actors, in particular the role played by the owner of the airplane, which made supervision complicated; - The failure by the operator, at Conakry and Cotonou, to call on service companies to supply information on the airplanes loading; - The Captains agreement to undertake the take-off with an airplane for which he had not been able to establish the weight; - The short length of the runway at Cotonou; - The time of day chosen for the departure of the flight, when it was particularly hot; - The very wide margins, in particular in relation to the airplanes weight, which appeared to exist, due to the use of an inappropriate document to establish the airplanes weight and balance sheet; - The existence of a non-frangible building one hundred and eighteen meters after the runway threshold."

	   Ethiopia",Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Bahar Dar Airport (BJR/HABD),Asmara International Airport (ASM/HAAY),"Ethiopian Airlines flight 604, a Boeing 737-200, was a scheduled service from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar and Asmara. The first leg of the flight was uneventful. At 09:50, the engines were started normally and the airplane was taxied to its take-off position. The flight crew reported that In order to gain additional thrust they elected not to use engine bleed air during take-off.  The airplane accelerated at a normal rate during the take-off roll and passed V1 (take-off-reject) speed. As the airplane passed V1 and very near VR (rotation speed) the flight crew saw a flock of pigeons lifting up from the left side. At this time the captain took over control from the copilot and pulled up. Almost immediately after rotation, the airplane struck the flock of pigeons at an airspeed of 146 knots and altitude of 5730 feet above mean sea level. Loud bangs were heard. The captain then called for gear up and the copilot complied. At approximately 100-200 ft. above the ground, both engines started backfiring. At this time, the flight crew reported that they experienced a considerable power loss and the airplane started mushing down at which time the captain ""fire walled"" the thrust levers. The engines reportedly responded and the airplane began to gain some altitude. The gain in attitude encouraged the captain to make a right turn away from Lake Tana and back to the take-off runway for landing. During the initial 32 seconds after the impact, the airplane had gained altitude from 5,730 feet to 6,020 feet and had accelerated from 146 knots to 154 knots. The crew report further indicated that both engines continued to surge and the exhaust gas temperature gauges (EGT) were reading at the top extreme and the engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge readings were fluctuating at about 1.6. During this time the captain reported that the he reduced engine thrust to prolong the operational life of the engines. The frequency of the surges decreased with engines power reduction. The airplane entered an approximate 90 degree right turn. Altitude remained constant 6,020 feet while its airspeed increased from 154 knots to 162 knots. The airplane then began another right turn and entered the downwind leg of the return to runway 04. Altitude had increased to 6,410 feet and airspeed to 173 knots. On the downwind leg the aircraft further climbed to 7,100 feet. Then, within a timeframe of about five seconds, both engines lost power completely. The copilot pointed out a cleared area slightly ahead and to the right. The captain then turned towards the clearing and performed a gear-up landing. The aircraft broke up and a fire erupted. Out of the 104 occupants, 35 suffered fatal injuries.  PROBABLE CAUSE: "" The accident occurred because the airplane could not be safely returned to the runway after the internal destruction and subsequent failure of both engines to operate arising from multiple bird ingestion by both engines during take-off."""

	   Pakistan",Initial climb,Cargo,Karachi-Jinnah International Airport (KHI/OPKC),Khartoum-Civil Airport (KRT/HSSS),"An Ilyushin 76TD cargo plane, registered 4L-GNI, was destroyed in an accident near Karachi-Jinnah International Airport in Pakistan. All eight occupants and three persons on the ground were killed.  The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Karachi-Jinnah International Airport (KHI), Pakistan to Douala, Cameroon with a planned en route stop at Khartoum, Sudan. The flight was loaded with 30.5 tons of relief supplies (tents). After completion of necessary pre flight requisites by the flight crew, the cockpit crew contacted Karachi Airport at 01:14 hours local time and informed about their readiness to start for Khartoum. After receiving permission from the air traffic controller, the crew started the engines between 01:21 and 01:24. On previous flights the crew had encountered problems starting engine no.4. On those occasions the engine was finally started after switching on the Engine Anti Ice System. At Karachi, the flight crew proactively activated the Engine Anti Ice System before starting engine no.4. The most probable reason of abnormal starts of the engine no.4 was reduction of compressor efficiency because of blade wear. The service wear of blades increases axial and radial clearances and the blade surface becomes rough, thus reducing the compressor efficiency. With the inlet guide vanes heating mode on, the amount of air through the compressors first stages increases thus improving the start reliability. The crew then taxied the plane to runway 25L and took off at 01:43 hours. Shortly after takeoff, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of 100 meters, the no.4 engine suffered an uncontained failure. The airspeed was 325 km/h and undercarriage had been retracted. The remaining three engines continued working on takeoff power. The aircraft banked right, which the pilot tried to counteract with ailerons and rudder. The no.4 engine was then set to idle and subsequently shut down.  Despite fully deflected ailerons and spoilers to create a left bank, the aircraft continued in a right bank. Right bank had increased to 32° while the recorded deflection of the rudder was -24° (to the left) and elevator to -10° for pitch up. The aircraft reached a height 140 m before it entered a descent. At 01:44 the bank angle became 71° to the right and the aircraft continued moving to right and impacted buildings that were under construction.  Cause of Occurrence: The cause of the occurrence was uncontained failure of the 2nd stage disk of LP compressor of Engine # 4 due to fatigue fracture which resulted in in-flight fire and damage to adjacent areas of right wing / flaps to an extent that flight could not be sustained. The use of mishap engine beyond its manufacturers assigned life without assessment and life enhancement by the manufacturer was the cause of its uncontained fatigue failure."

Witnesses reported that the airplane assumed a higher than normal nose high attitude as soon as it departed. The airplane impacted the ground in a nose low attitude on a heading of 110 degrees in an avocado grove located on the east side of the departure course, 3.3 DME south of the airport.   Prior to entering service with TAESA June 1998, the aircraft had been used by NASA and was modified to support the reduced-gravity mission. As N650UG completed 193 flights for NASA (TT 436.3 hours) between May 29, 1995 and July 11, 1997.  Probable cause: ""Crash of the aircraft, after an overrotation on takeoff and a climb with a very pronounced angle, which caused the loss of control, with spatial disorientation (loss of the horizon), in a flight operation by instruments (IFR), in which, according to the crew, there was a possible failure of asymmetry indication in the leading edge flaps (slats), with the crew neglecting to control the flight of the aircraft.""  Contributing factors 1.- Inadequate preparation of information for instrument take-off (IFR) from Uruapan airport and failure to adhere to the operating procedures of the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) Manual. 2.- Failure to perform checklist procedures for the operation of the aircraft in its different phases. 3.- Loss of external vision (spatial disorientation), aggravated by turning on the cockpit lights, before the takeoff run. 4.- Inadequate procedure for the rotation of the aircraft during take-off, dragging the tail skid on the runway 5.- Angle of climb greater than that established in the aircraft Operations Manual. 6.- Lack of cockpit resource management (CRM)."

The plane was refueled and prepared for the flight back to Baku the co-pilot was to be the pilot flying. The airplane took off at 17:52. While climbing through a height of 60 meters after takeoff and at an airspeed of 317 km/h, the no. 1 engine failed. The co-pilot reacted by countering the left bank and five seconds later the flight engineer reported that the right-hand engine (no. 2) had failed. The captain took over control of the airplane. Because the co-pilot had countered the left bank, the captain did not have the sensory information which could have alerted him that it was the left-hand engine that had failed. The airplane continued to climb through 140 m, passing through a layer of smog following which the captain ordered the right-hand engine to be shut down. The flight engineer retarded the right throttle and noticed that the power on the operating engine was decreasing. He brought the throttle back to the original position, but the engine had already stopped. Eight seconds later, the flight engineer reported that both engines had failed. The airplane had reached an elevation of 197 m and the speed had decreased to 290 km/h. The captain then decided to carry out a forced landing.  The plane was then maneuvered for a forced landing during which a sharp right turn was made to avoid an apartment block. In a 37-degree right bank with a 10 m/sec (1960 feet/min) descent rate, the airplane crashed into a field in the southwestern outskirts Nakhichevan, 3850 m from the runway.  Investigation revealed that, following the mechanical failure of the left-hand engine, the crew shut down the working right-hand engine. The Tu-134B flight deck ergonomics contributed in that the flight engineers' engine parameters are difficult to monitor in conditions of weak illumination. The engine failed because it was operated for more than 30 hours with an unrepaired defect."

Sukhoi Su-15TM interceptor jets were sent to intercept the intruder. When both Sukhoi jets were flying next to the Korean airliner, the captain said he slowed down plane and switched on landing lights. Nevertheless the Su-15 crews were ordered to shoot down the plane. According to the U.S. the Su-15 pilot for several minutes tried to convince his superiors to cancel the attack, because the aircraft was a civilian Boeing 707 instead of a reconnaissance Boeing RC-135. After an additional order two P-60 rockets were launched. One of them missed the 707 but the other rocket exploded, severely damaging part of the left wing. Shrapnel punctured the fuselage, causing a rapid decompression and killing two passengers. The Korean pilot initiated an emergency descent from FL350 to 5000 feet and entered clouds.

Some 20,423 pounds of cargo was offloaded and new cargo was loaded for the return leg to Bogotá. Meanwhile, at 15:00 hours the aircraft became uncontrolled as had been published per Notam. In the minutes before the planned departure, a Cessna 208 and an Embraer ERJ-170 passenger plane took off from runway 07. The wind at the time was about 010 degrees at 8 knots.  Subsequently the Boeing 727 taxied onto the runway, backtracking to the runway 25 threshold. At the same time the crew worked the respective checklists prior to takeoff and made a blind radio transmission, stating their imminent departure from Puerto Carreño. The aircraft then made a 180° turn and aligned for takeoff. Flaps were set at 30°and 6½ elevator trim units were selected. The flight crew then noted that they did not know the direction and intensity of the wind. Takeoff was commenced at 17:18 hours.  After travelling the entire length of the 1800 m long runway, the aircraft had not become airborne. It travelled another 95 meters over grass until it struck a section of the perimeter fence. It crossed a road, hit a shed and a tree. The aircraft became airborne, but as a result of the impact, the right hand main landing gear had separated, the trailing inboard right flap was damaged, a loss of power in engine no.3 occurred and a leakage of hydraulic fluid from System A was noticed by the crew. The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 790 feet and entered a slight right hand descending turn until it impacted flat terrain, bursting into flames. The weight and balance manifest of the accident flight was not found among the remains of the aircraft, nor was a copy of it in the company's office. It is presumed that the aircraft took off from Puerto Carreño with 19,820 pounds distributed on 9 pallets. According to the flight plan, there were five persons on board. In fact there was a sixth person on the flight.  A video posted on Youtube in October 2016 shows a takeoff of an Aerosucre Boeing 727 at Puerto Carreño Airport barely clearing the perimeter fence.  Probable causes: Inadequate flight planning by the operator of the aircraft, and by the crew, by failure to properly perform dispatch procedures, take-off performance calculations and verification of limitations imposed by operational conditions of the aerodrome according to the configuration of the aircraft. Wrong crew decision making by not considering a key aspect affecting aircraft performance, such as the prevailing tailwind at take-off. Erroneous selection of take-off speeds V1/VR and V2, by the crew, corresponding to an aircraft without modification in its flap system, which led to rotate the aircraft with five more knots of speed, increasing the takeoff run. Erroneous rotation technique applied by the Pilot, delayed maneuver that extended the long takeoff run even more. Loss of components (landing gear, trailing inboard flap right) and damage to functional systems (loss of engine power No.3 and hydraulic system) necessary to control the aircraft in flight. Loss of control in flight generated by asymmetries of lift, power and emptying of the main hydraulic systems that exceeded the capacity of the crew and made it impossible to maintain adequate directional control and stability of the aircraft.  Contributing Factors: Non-compliance with the Aeronautical Regulations by the operating company of the aircraft, operating to an aerodrome unsuitable for the operation of B727-200 equipment, which, in addition, was not authorized for that type of aircraft in the company's Operating Specifications, approved by the Aeronautical Authority. Lack of standardization and supervision of the operating company of the aircraft, allowing the operation of the B727-200 equipment, to which a modification had been applied to the flap system, with the reference tables of speeds corresponding to the aircraft without modification. Execution of take-off with a weight that exceeded the maximum value established in the aircraft performance charts for the conditions prevailing at the Germán Olano airport. Omission of the crew by not activating the Standby hydraulic system, which might have allowed emergency hydraulic pressure, to regain control of the aircraft. Lack of supervision by the Aeronautical Authority, which allowed for several years the operation of equipment B727-200 of the company operating the aircraft at the Germán Olano aerodrome in Puerto Carreño, when the characteristics of the aerodrome did not allow it and without the operator being authorized to operate equipment B727-200 in that aerodrome."

The aircraft took off from Denver at 09:23 for the last segment of the flight, estimating Colorado Springs at 09:42. The aircraft was cleared for a visual approach to runway 35. The aircraft then suddenly rolled to the right and started to pitch nose down. The crew tried to initiate a go-around by selecting 15-deg. flaps and an increase in thrust. The altitude decreased rapidly, acceleration increased to over 4G until the aircraft struck the ground of Widefield Park almost vertically. After a 21-month investigation, the NTSB issued a report on the crash in December 1992. In that report, the NTSB said it 'could not identify conclusive evidence to explain the loss of' the aircraft, but indicated that the two most likely explanations were a malfunction of the airplanes directional control system or an encounter with an unusually severe atmospheric disturbance.  Investigation into a September 1994 crash of a USAir Boeing 737-300 and an loss of control incident on June 9, 1996 (Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737-200), cited a malfunction in the planes rudder system as the most likely cause of all three events.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of control of the airplane resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit. The rudder surface most likely deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder power control unit servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the primary slide."""

At 13:41 the flight contacted Port Harcourt while maintaining FL240. The approach controller then gave the flight an in-bound clearance for an ILS approach to runway 21.  About 13:50, the crew contacted Approach Control for initial descent clearance and was cleared down to FL160. The aircraft continued its descent until about 14:00 hours when the crew asked Approach Control whether it was raining to which the controller reported negative rain but scattered CB and the crew acknowledged. At 14:04, the crew reported established on the glide slope and the localizer at 8 nautical miles to touch down. Then the Approach controller informed the aircraft of precipitation approaching the airport from the direction of runway 21 and passed the aircraft to the Tower controller for landing instructions. The flight contacted Port Harcourt Tower and reported established on glide slope and localizer at 6 nautical miles to touch down. The controller then cleared the airplane to land on runway 21 but to exercise caution as the runway surface was slightly wet and the pilot acknowledged. On final approach, the flight encountered adverse weather with wind speed and direction changing from 220 deg/09 kts to 360 deg/05 kts.  Although the runway was not in sight, the crew continued their descent below Decision Altitude. The crew initiated a go-around below the altitude of 204ft, which is 103ft below the Decision Altitude; the attempt of which was not successful. The aircraft continued until the tail section contacted the grass area between runway 21 and a taxiway, 70 metres to the left of the runway edge and 540 metres from the runway threshold. Some 60 m further on, the rear fuselage impacted an exposed concrete drainage culvert. The no. 2 engine was sheared off and the rear airstair broke away from the fuselage. The aircraft disintegrated and caught fire, skidding for another 790 m. The cockpit section with the forward fuselage was found a further 330 m from the rest of the wreckage trail on the taxiway, giving a total wreckage distance of 1120 m.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of the accident was the crew's decision to continue the approach beyond the Decision Altitude without having the runway and/or airport in sight. The contributory factors were: 1. The crew's delayed decision to carry out a missed approach and the application of improper procedure while executing the go-around. 2. The aircraft encountered adverse weather conditions with the ingredients of wind shear activity on approach. 3. The reducing visibility in thunderstorm and rain as at the time the aircraft came in to land was also a contributory factor to the accident. And the fact the airfield lightings were not on may also have impaired the pilot from sighting the runway. 4. Another contributory factor was the fact that the aircraft had an impact with the exposed drainage concrete culvert which led to its disintegration and subsequent fire outbreak."""

The aircraft took off from runway 27 at 21:27. Approach control then asked the crew to increase their speed. The speed increased progressively to 304 knots, exceeding the 250 knots maximum speed inside the terminal control area below 10000 feet. While Flight 527 was flying towards mountainous terrain and increasing its speed (in the north sector of the radar scope), the controller was busy vectoring an excessive amount of traffic in the south sector. The assistant departure controller failed to monitor the traffic. When the controller turned his attention to LH527 again, he was surprised by the position of the aircraft and instructed 'LH, turn right heading 140, just now, over'. The controller repeated his instructions and instructed the crew to increase their rate of climb. At that time the GPWS sounded in the cockpit.  The aircraft struck trees on the slope of a mountain in a nose-up, left wing down attitude and continued 800 m while breaking up.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""It is clear that there was a breakdown in team-work of the personnel on duty in Rio approach control at that time. The departure controller, through incomplete instructions, caused LH527 to fly for a period of time on a heading and at an altitude that led the aircraft to collision. The assistant controller, the co-ordinator and the supervisor on duty did not support the departure controller as they should have done. A contributing factor was that the crew accepted the incomplete ATC instructions (no clearance limit or alternate procedure) and flew during 1 min 41s without bilateral communications and in potential danger inherent in these incomplete instructions."""

The aircraft crashed in the jungle while performing a Delta 1 arrival to runway 10.  Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) . Physiological Aspect  - There was no evidence of this aspect contributing to the occurrence of the accident. (2). Psychological Aspect - Contributed - The psychological aspect contributed through the generation of a high level of anxiety to perform the landing and in the diversion of the focus of attention during the approach manoeuvres to land. - The psychological aspect was influenced by the activation of the smoke alarm which generated an increase in the workload on board. b. Material Factor  - There were no indications that this factor contributed to the accident. c. Operational Factor (1). Deficient Instruction  - Although the instruction was carried out in accordance with what the standards recommend, the failures that contributed to the accident are characteristic of lack of experience in facing abnormalities simultaneously with the maintenance of flight control. Such failures could be avoided with more adequate simulator instructions and training involving the cockpit management aspects. (2). Poor Maintenance - Undetermined . - It was not possible to determine the cause of the activation of the ""Aft Cargo Smoke"" alarm and whether the maintenance services contributed to this occurrence. (3). Deficient Cockpit Coordination  - Inadequate performance of the duties assigned to each crew member. The procedures foreseen for the execution of descent by instrument have been modified and some have been deleted depending on the appearance of a complicator element (smoke alarm). (4). Influence of the environment  - The dark night contributed to the creation of the ""black hole"" phenomenon, or ""background figure"", making it difficult to perceive external references for a possible identification of the vertical distance of the aircraft from the ground. (5). Deficient Oversight  - The supervision, at cockpit level, contributed to the accident by the inadequate management of the resources available for the flight in the cockpit. - Company level supervision contributed to the accident by not identifying the need for cockpit management training and providing it to the crew involved. - Supervision, at company level, was also inadequate when climbing to the same mission, two pilots unfamiliar with the airplane to be used and in night operation. (6). Other Operational Aspects  - The failure to comply with several ""Callouts"", the non-use of the radio altimeter and the inadequate use of the ""altitude alert"", as an aid to the accomplishment of the descent procedure, contributed to the occurrence of the accident."

CONCLUSION: The airplane flew an approach in conditions worse than weather minimums for the airfield and the crew failed decide to go-around. Instead the airplane descended below the minimum safe altitude in the absence of visual contact with approaching lighting and landmarks, which led to contact with trees and the ground in controlled flight.  Contributing factors were:  - Poor interaction of the crew and poor crew resource management (CRM) from the commander of the flight during the approach. The pilot subordinated himself to the navigator causing the co-pilot to be effectively excluded from decisions.  - The use during the flight of a navigator in a light level of alcoholic intoxication - Incorrect weather forecast with regards to height of the cloud base, visibility and severe weather - fog.  - The use of navigation equipment that used satellite navigation to determine the aircrafts position, which was in violation of the Flight Manual Supplement for the Tu-134."

They lost control of the aircraft which entered a steep descent and started to disintegrate at FL100, and impacting the ground 80 degrees nose down.  The probable causes of this accident include: a) loss of control of the aircraft because the flight crew followed false information from an attitude indicator that operated intermittently. b) lack of visible horizon during cruise flight due to night and approaching bad weather. c) insufficient cross-checking between the primary and emergency (stand-by) attitude indicators to identify intermittent attitude errors and to select a reliable source of (correct) attitude information. d) non-standard cabin configurations between aircraft in the fleet of the company, which required the crew to determine how to set the switches based on the aircraft was being operated at the time. e) incomplete ground crew training simulator, as it did not present ""differences between aircraft"" and ""crew resource management"" in sufficient detail to give the crew knowledge to overcome intermittent attitude indicator errors and to maintain control of the aircraft."

Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival. The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara.  At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290°) to southeast (120°) with fog again worsening the visibility. Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg. At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m. At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees.  At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back.  The Technical Commission came to the following conclusion: The reason for the crash of TU-134A RA-65021 during the approach to landing at Kurumoch Airport, Samara, in weather conditions significantly below minima for the airport, aircraft, and crew, was the destruction of the aircraft during its travel over the ground after a hard touchdown 300 meters short of the runway and 100 meters to the right of the approach course. The accident resulted from organizational, technical, and procedural deficiencies in the work and interaction of the weather and air traffic control services, as well as from crew errors. Deficiencies in the standards and technical documentation of the Samara Airport made it impossible for Air Traffic Control to inform the crew on a timely basis of the readings from the KRAMS-4 weather station, which indicated a deterioration of weather conditions below airport minima. At decision height, in the absence of reliable visual contact with the approach lights and airport environment, the flight crew did not make a timely decision to execute a missed approach. The air traffic controllers failure to use the full capability of the radar equipment because of contradictions in the relevant standards and procedures documents, as well as poor coordination among the flight crew and their delay in executing a missed approach, made it impossible to avoid a tragedy. The lack of unified federal regulations covering flight operations, Air Traffic Control, and weather and other services, taking into account both domestic and international experience in flight safety, contributed to this aviation accident."

He was reminded by the controller that the wind was from 090 magnetic, but he still insisted on using the 23 approach.  At 08:42, the aircraft commenced its initial descent at 48 miles on the ILS/DME to 4,500 ft. At 08:49 UTC, it was cleared to 3,500 ft at 10 miles out and was later descended to 500 ft. The aircraft turned left from the track 310 to align with runway 23 and the aircraft was still in the turn when the threshold was sighted just 1.5 miles to the left of the aircraft. The first officer asked the captain ""Can you make it to land from that position?"". The observer in the jump seat also suggested going on the downwind, presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. There was no response at all from the captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft to the left of the runway centreline and a right correction was applied. The observer shouted ""Watch the wing"" as the wings could have struck the ground on the final approach. By this time, the aircraft crossed the threshold with the flying pilot still struggling to maintain directional control for runway centreline alignment. The aircraft touched down 7820 feet down the runway, leaving just 2020 ft (615.85 m) of runway length. The captain was reported to have used 1.8 and 1.6 EPR on the reversers. When a runway overrun became inevitable, the captain turned the aircraft to the left with the intention to take advantage of the last rapid exit intersection to avoid the runway end lights. At this juncture, the aircraft entered an uncontrollable skid. The right wing hit the ground, thus rupturing the fuel tanks and a huge fire erupted. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire.  PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: ""The probable cause of the accident is the continuation of a highly unstabilized approach when the option of a missed approach could have been taken. The contributing factor was the turn off at 76 knots into the high speed intersection when an overrun into the extended runway end should have been maintained."""

It subsequently broke up and crashed, killing all 44 on board.  It crashed almost simultaneously with a Sibir Tupolev Tu-154 which had also departed Domodedovo earlier that night. Traces of an explosive device were found in the wreckage. It appeared that the explosives had been carried aboard by a female passenger. Two female suicide bombers arrived at Moscow at 19:45 on the same day on a flight from Makhachkala in the company of another two Chechens. They had taken aside on arrival and were handed to a police captain in charge of antiterrorist precautions, but they were released without apparently having been searched. Both women then bought tickets on the Sibir flight to Sochi and the Volga-Aviaexpress to Volgograd from a black-market peddler. After bribing a Sibir Airlines employee in charge of check-in and boarding one of the women was able to bypass security and get on board the Tupolev Tu-154.  The cause of the crashes of Tu-154 RA 85556 and Tu-134 RA 65080 aircrafts on August 24, 2004 was the destruction of aircraft construction in flight as a result of the impact of explosive charges."

A forced landing was attempted on River Chamba, but the aircraft struck the river bank and crashed.  The fact-finding of the commission for investigation, concluded that occurred as a result of a.o, a combination of the following unfavorable factors: - incorrect calculation by the crew of the necessary quantity of fuel for the execution of flight to Tura taking into account Vanavara being the alternate airport;  - sudden weather deterioration on Tura Airport, about which the crew was not informed in time; - failure by Tura airport personnel to conduct observations at a time when the weather was worsening, and failure of the flight control officer to keep proper control of the work of the subordinates;  - the deviation, allowed by crew during the first straight-in approach, which was caused, probably, by short-term de-energizing of the Outer Marker beacon and by incorrect determination by the crew of removal to VPP under these conditions;  - failure of the crew to monitor the approach pattern parameters during the second and third approaches into Tura under the weather conditions below the established minimum;  - wrong decision by the crew regarding the shortage of fuel by choosing the alternate Of Vanavara instead of Baykit Airport, located on 110 km closer;  - the error of the crew in the selection flight altitude and the premature descent into Vanavara."

The flight departed at 20:22 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL330. The en route and descent were uneventful. At 21:32 UTC the flight was cleared for an approach to runway 30. Nine minutes later the flight reported 3,5 NM out at 1100 feet with runway in sight. The tower controller then cleared the flight to land. The aircraft overflew the runway threshold and started to climb. The flight radioed that they were 'having problems' and that they would report back. The tower controller then saw the aircraft in a sharp left hand turn. The airplane descended until it impacted a mangrove swamp.  PROBABLE CAUSES (translated from French): The probable cause of the accident is a of loss of control during a go-around attempt made during a maneuver to reach the runway with degraded performance. Seriously contributing to this: 1 - The detachment by structural fatigue of a first stage compressor blade of the No. 1 engine which resulted in a loss of power and destabilization of the trajectory when landing 2 - The late or slow execution of the go-around procedure with an unidentified single-engine configuration, leading to irreversible loss of speed."

The flight to Wichita was routine. En route to Kansas City, the crew deviated from course to avoid thunderstorms, but the descent into the terminal area was routine. At 21:42 flight 721 contacted the TRACON arrival radar controller. The controller directed the flight to turn to 060 degrees and told the flightcrew that they were being vectored to the ILS localizer for the ILS approach to runway 1. About 21:47 while the airplane was descending through about 6,500 feet, the first officer, who had been flying the airplane, turned the controls over to the captain. Buffalo Airways' regulations required captains to make all the approaches and landings whenever the ceilings and visibilities were less than 400 feet and 1 mile, respectively. At 21:50, after several intermediate descent clearances, flight 721 was cleared to descend to 2,400 feet. At 21:51, the controller told flight 721 that it was ""five miles from DOTTE (the LOM), turn left zero four zero, maintain two thousand four hundred until established, cleared ILS runway one approach."" The crew had completed the before-landing checklist, the landing gear was down and locked, and the flaps had been extended to 25 degrees, as required, for landing. At 21:52:40, the local controller advised flight 721 that it was No. 2 to land and that the winds were zero four zero at eight knots, and that the RVR on runway 1 was more than 6,000 feet. At 21:52:47, the first officer stated, ""Localizer alive."" The first office reported the airplane's altitude during the descent in 100-foot increments above ""minimums (DH)"" until the airplane reached the decision height. At 21:53:07, the first officer called, ""Marker inbound."" The flightcrew then received ATIS information ""Sierra"" which stated that the weather at the airport was in part: ceiling--100 feet, overcast; visibility 1/2 mile, fog; wind 40° at 8 knots. At 21:53:24, the captain remarked, ""Already started the approach."" At 21:53:32, 4 seconds after reporting that the airplane was 200 feet above minimums, the first officer told the local controller that, ""Seven twenty-one is the marker inbound."" The local controller acknowledged receipt of the message. At 21:53:41, after receiving a low-altitude alert generated by the Automated Radar Tracking System III (ARTS III) computer's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) function, the local controller warned flight 721 to ""check altitude immediately should be two thousand four hundred, altimeter two nine six one."" Flight 721 did not respond. However, the captain said ""Call the radar (radio) altimeter please."" At 21:53:46, the first officer responded, ""Okay, there's twelve hundred on the (radio) altimeter."" At 21:53:50, the local controller again called the flight and warned, ""I have a low altitude alert, climb and maintain two thousand four hundred."" Again, the flightcrew did not acknowledge receipt of the warning. At 21:53:51, a crewmember called out ""pull it up,"" and at 2153:52, the captain applied power followed almost simultaneously by sounds of initial impact. Flight 721 struck the tops of trees on a 950-foot-high ridge about 3 nmi short of the approach end of runway 1. The airplane cut a relatively level 750- to 800-foot-long swath through the tree tops about 20 to 30 feet above the ground. The swath ended as the ridge and tree tops sloped downward. The airplane then rolled and turned to the right as it descended into the main impact area 2,000 feet beyond the initial impact site. All four occupants were killed.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captains intentional descent below the DH. Contributing to the accident was the breakdown in flightcrew coordination procedures which contributed to the failure of the captain and the first officer to detect that the airplane had not intercepted and was below the ILS glideslope. Also contributing to the accident was the failure, for unknown reasons, of the airplanes GPWS to provide an unsafe deviation below the ILS glideslope warning."""

During the left turn, the aircraft stalled. The plane then grazed a few single-storied houses in a government residential housing estate at Aneeshabad and exploded into a ball of fire. The aircraft broke into four pieces. The accident site is located about 2 km southwest of the Patna Airport.  Weather reported at 07:30 included temperature 30deg C (86 F), dewpoint 27deg C (80 F); 997 mB; wind calm, haze, 4000 m visibility. The aircraft in question, VT-EGD, had been involved in an accident 14 years ago. On January 15, 1986, the pilot of flight 529 attempted to land at Tiruchirapalli in conditions below weather minima. During a go-around the wing contacted the runway due to an excessive bank angle. The wing was substantially damaged, but there were no injuries among the 6 crew and 122 passengers.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due Human Error (air crew).  The crew had not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach.  They had kept the engines at idle thrust and allowed the air speed to reduce to a lower than normally permissible value on approach.  They then maneuvered the aircraft with high pitch attitude and executed rapid roll reversals.  This resulted in actuation of the stick shaker stall warning indicating an approaching stall.  At this stage, the crew initiated a Go Around procedure instead of Approach to Stall Recovery procedure resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft, loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground."""

A second approach was attempted, this time to runway 25. This was also abandoned due to poor visibility. RVR values for runway 34L (1600 m, 2000 m and 150 m resp. at Alfa, Bravo and Charlie) made the crew request radar vectoring to runway 34L. The aircraft was established on the localizer at 00:28. The aircraft continued to descend below the 420 feet MDA, although the runway visual markings hadn't been located. Because the flight crew failed to use the altitude callouts, the GPWS sounded unexpectedly.

Besides, the following factors may have contributed to the cause of the accident: 1) Presumed mental and physical fatigue, accumulated by the crew during the two previous landing approaches, which were also carried out in an environmental situation that was extremely unfavourable and operationally demanding.; 2) A configuration of the Altitude Instruments, which although sufficient for the approaches that were carried out, consisted of a single radio altimeter with the acoustic warning of the MDA crossing inoperative; 3) The attention of the crew was excessively concentrated on the luminous sources along runway 34L, instead of on the instrument readings. Furthermore (...) part of the Board of Inquiry as well as the representative of the Ugandan CA, disassociated themselves from the majority, during the phase of identifying the factors that may have contributed to causing the accident."""

At 13:56:47 Santa Maria Tower cleared the flight to descend to 3000 feet for a runway 19 ILS approach: ""Independent Air one eight five one roger reclear to three thousand feet on QNH one zero two seven and runway will be one niner."" In that transmission, the trainee controller had transmitted an incorrect QNH that was 9 hPa too high. The actual QNH was 1018.7 hPa. After a brief pause the message resumed at 13:56:59: ""expect ILS approach runway one niner report reaching three thousand."" This transmission was not recorded on the voice recorder of Flight 1851, probably because the first officer keyed his mike and read back: ""Were recleared to 2,000 feet and ah ... ."" The first officer paused from 13:57:02 to 13:57:04, then unkeyed the mike momentarily. This transmission was not recorded on the ATS tapes. In the cockpit, the first officer questioned aloud the QNH value, but the captain agreed that the first officer had correctly understood the controller. After being cleared for the ILS approach the crew failed to accomplish an approach briefing, which would have included a review of the approach plate and minimum safe altitude. If the approach plate had been properly studied, they would have noticed that the minimum safe altitude was 3,000 feet and not 2,000 feet, as it had been understood, and they would have noticed the existence and elevation of Pico Alto. At 14:06, the flight was 7.5 nm from the point of impact, and beginning to level at 2,000 feet (610 meters) in light turbulence at 250 KIAS. At 14:07, the flight was over Santa Barbara and entering clouds at approximately 700 feet (213 meters) AGL in heavy turbulence at 223 KIAS. At 14:07:52, the captain said, ""Cant keep this SOB thing straight up and down"". At approximately 14:08, the radio altimeter began to whine, followed by the GPWS alarm as the aircraft began to climb because of turbulence, but there was no reaction on the part of the flight crew. At 14:08:12, the aircraft was level when it impacted a mountain ridge of Pico Alto. It collided with a rock wall on the side of a road at the mountain top at an altitude of approximately 1,795 feet (547 meters) AMSL.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Board of Inquiry understands that the accident was due to the non-observance by the crew of established operating procedures, which led to the deliberate descent of the aircraft to 2000ft in violation the minimum sector altitude of 3000ft, published in the appropriate aeronautical charts and cleared by the Santa Maria Aerodrome Control Tower. Other factors: 1) Transmission by the Santa Maria Aerodrome Control Tower of a QNH value 9 hPa higher than the actual value, which put the aircraft at an actual altitude 240ft below that indicated on board.; 2) Deficient communications technique on the part of the co-pilot, who started reading back the Tower's clearance to descend to 3000ft before the Tower completed its transmission, causing a communications overlap.; 3) Violation by the Aerodrome Control Tower of established procedures by not requiring a complete read back of the descent clearance.; 4) Non-adherence by the crew to the operating procedures published in the appropriate company manuals, namely with respect to cockpit discipline, approach briefing , repeating aloud descent clearances, and informal conversations in the cockpit below 10000ft.; 5) General crew apathy in dealing with the mistakes they made relating tot the minimum sector altitude, which was known by at least one of the crew members, and to the ground proximity alarms.; 6) Non-adherence to standard phraseology both by the crew and by Air Traffic Control in some of the air-ground communications.; 7) Limited experience of the crew, especially the co-pilot, in international flights.; 8) Deficient crew training, namely concerning the GPWS as it did not include emergency manoeuvres to avoid collision into terrain.; 9) Use of a route which was not authorized in the AIP Portugal.; 10) The operational flight plan, whose final destination was not the SMA beacon, was not developed in accordance with the AIP Portugal."""

The estimated time of arrival (ETA) at Kabul International Airport was 10:55 UTC. The aircraft was cruising at flight level 270 when it contacted Bagram Radar Approach Control (""Bagram"") for descent and landing. The flight was normal until it failed to level at flight level 130 during the VOR/DME approach. At 10:43 UTC, Bagram cleared the flight to descend at its discretion and to expect the VOR approach to runway 29. The prevailing weather was also passed on to the aircraft. Visibility was reported 2 kilometers with snow, ceiling 2200 feet broken. wind calm and altimeter setting QNH 1016. When the aircraft was 35 miles west of the Kabul VOR, radar contact was established with Bagram. The aircraft was advised by Bagram to cross the VOR at or above flight level 130 and cleared it for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29 at Kabul Airport. At 10:48 UTC the aircraft reported flight level 130. Bagram again cleared the aircraft for the VOR approach to runway 29 and advised the aircraft to report procedure turn inbound. The crew replied that they would report proceeding inbound for the VOR approach to runway 29. This was the last transmission from the aircraft.  Search for the aircraft was delayed and hampered due to a severe snowstorm in the region.

	   Russia",En route,Military,Chkalovsky Airport (CKL/UUMU),Belgorod Airport (EGO/UUOB),"On the morning of 24 January 2024, an Ilyushin Il-76 strategic airlifter aircraft of the Russian Air Force crashed in a field in the Belgorod region at high speed following an in flight breakup and loss of flight control.   Later that day, Russian State News Agency TASS, citing a report from the Russian Ministry of Defence reported that an Il-76 carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, 6 flight crew and 3 marshals had crashed in the Belgorod region. The Governor of Belgorod Oblast further stated later that day that all those on board the aircraft were confirmed dead. Russian sources further claimed that the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence had been notified of the flight.   Initially, Ukrainian sources such as Ukrainska Pravda reported that Ukrainian forces had shot down an Il-76 aircraft transporting S-300 missiles. However, this was later amended to not claim or deny involvement in the crash. According to a spokesman for the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR), a prisoner exchange had been scheduled on the day of the crash, but stated that this did not occur. The reason for this was not explained further. Ukrainian sources have further offered other alternative scenarios while emphasising that the aircraft was a legitimate military target, stating that the aircraft may have been targeted for carrying senior Russian military officials, downed by friendly fire, or being used to transport weapons or ammunition. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky stated that the  Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) would also be conducting an investigation into the crash. However, the viability of this investigation was not described in further detail.  On the afternoon of 24 January 2024, British based British Broadcasting Channel (BBC) News reported that two official statements were made by the Ukrainian General Staff and the HUR that ""amount to acknowledgement that Ukraine may have shot the plane down"". Citing an anonymous source, French news site franceinfo reported that the aircraft had been downed by an American origin Patriot air defence system.  On 25 January 2024, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation (SKR) released an official statement announcing the start of investigations into the crash. Alongside this statement, a several video releases were made showing a large debris trail. TASS further reported that metal fragments, possibly identified as belonging to an air defence missile had been found at the crash site, quoting:  ""A vast area is being combed for any fragments of the airplane and metal structures. On the ground, elements confirming the external impact on the airplane have been found. They will be sent for examination""  Furthermore, the Office of the Governor and Government of Orenburg Oblast reported that the crew was made up of local residents of the 117th Military Transport Aviation Regiment based in Orenburg, listing the dead crew as: - Captain Stanislav Bezzubkin - First Officer Alexey Vysokin - Flight Engineer Andrey Piluev - Technician Sergey Zhitenev - Radio Operator Igor Sablinsky  On 25 January 2024, a manifest claiming to list the described Ukrainian prisoners of war was published by Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Russian state broadcaster RT.  Later on 26 January 2024, SKR released another statement stating that Ukrainian servicemen had been positively identified as victims in the disaster, through verification through DNA examination as well as physical identification through ""characteristic tattoos"", including a Ukrainian tryzub. In addition, it was claimed that document evidence had been found confirming the identity of some of the passengers. Finally, the SKR claimed that through investigation of radar traces, air-defence missiles had been launched from the vicinity of the village of Liptsy, Kharkov Oblast, Ukraine - a location close to the Russo-Ukrainian border. Russian sources further state that the alleged shoot-down was carried out using an air defence system such as the MIM-104 Patriot, used by Ukraine. The Russian investigation committee additionally released footage of an Il-76 at Chkalovsky Airport being loaded. The agency did not specify when the video was recorded. However, a number of vehicles consistent with the markings of Russian prisoner transport trucks can be seen. On the same day, Russian state news agency TASS reported that the flight data and cockpit voice recorders had been recovered from the crash.  On 28 January 2024, Kyrylo Budanov, Head of Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence, has said that ""neither Russia nor Ukraine has a complete answer as to what happened when the Il-76 aircraft crashed in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast"".  On 30 January 2024, TASS reported that the data retrieved from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders confirmed  that the aircraft had been destroyed as a result of an external impact.  ""The data from the black boxes exclude all possible versions of the Ilyushin-76 crash and confirm that the plane was subjected to an external impact. In other words, it was shot down in the air. Everything is obvious,"" the source said.  On 1 February 2024, SKR released another press statement. The investigative committee stated that during the inspection of the area surrounding the crash site, the remains of two missiles with inscriptions and markings in the English language were discovered, complete with various serial numbers and manufacturing labels. It published a short video showing investigators inspecting some of the missile fragments on the ground in an unspecified location. One of the fragments included the what appears to have the word ""ATRIOT"" labeled in English. Furthermore, through the use of ion mobility spectrometry, traces of hexogen (RDX) and octogen (HMX) were identified.  ""The fragments seized from the scene, according to their design features, geometric characteristics and available markings, are structural elements of the MIM-104 anti-aircraft guided missile of the Patriot complex of the United States, developed by Raytheon and Hughes corporations and manufactured by Raytheon,"" the committee said.  A separate video from SKR showed officials putting what they said were body fragments into bags for evidence. It showed tattooed skin and said that, checked against DNA and identity records Russian authorities hold of Ukrainian prisoners of war, the investigation proved that those killed were Ukrainian soldiers. Russia had earlier stated that it had recovered Ukrainian identity documents and tattooed body parts from the crash site.   Ukraine did not immediately comment on the statement by the investigative committee and has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, but has challenged details of Moscow's account and called for an international investigation.  Following the retrieval of Patriot MIM-104A missile fragments, US State Department deputy principal spokesperson Vedant Patel was asked whether this would be investigated further by the United States. In response, Patel stated: ""Is this the same level of credible evidence that makes Russia claim that they have Crimea, or that all the territory that they took from Ukraine is theirs?"" When prompted that Patriot fragments were documented, Patel refrained from commenting further, redirecting the issue to Ukraine.  On 18 February 2024, Russian affiliated news channel Sputnik alleged that British advisors were responsible for the downing of the aircraft. According to the news source, an unnamed source stated: ""The attack on the Il-76 was carried out under pressure from British advisers without coordination with the air defense headquarters in Kiev and without additional double-checking of information on aircraft movements over the Belgorod region"""

The flight took off at 11:30 UTC and arrived in near Guarulhos Airport shortly before 15:00 UTC (12:00 hours local time). Since an aircraft had become immobilised on runway 09L, the aircraft was cleared for an approach to runway 09R. However, this runway was going to close for maintenance at 15:00 UTC. A rushed high speed approach was flown. About 14:55 UTC the instructor selected full flaps and speedbrakes, leading to a loss of control. The left wing of the aircraft struck a building. The aircraft crashed into a residential area near the intersection of Rua Rua Regente Feijó and Rua Sandovalina in the Jardim Ipanema neighborhood and burst into flames. Three crew members and 22 persons on the ground were killed.  This 707 was used in the 1970 movie ""Airport"" when it was still owned by Flying Tigers.  Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Psychological aspect - the imminent interruption of operations in the aerodrome that would be used for landing the aircraft stimulated the instructor to make a hurried descent, characterizing a potential state of anxiety. (2) Physiological aspect - there are indications that it contributed to fatigue b. Material Factor - Did not contribute c. Operational Factor - It was a determining factor for the occurrence of the accident through the following aspects: (1) Poor instruction - The instruction given to the pilot was discontinued and the local flight did not comply with the minima provided in RAC 3211. (2) Poor supervision - The failures found in the instruction were due to poor supervision of the Company's operations sector. (3) Poor cockpit coordination  	- During the descent procedure when working check list, the instructor broke the sequence of standardized procedures, thus stopping the instruction and consequently, the student's core handling of the flight 	- The instructor, without the student being informed beforehand, commanded the flaps together with the ""speed brake"". This action configured an abnormal attitude that contributed, without the pilots identifying, to the loss of control of the aircraft 	- The flight engineer also failed to meet the checklist items. (4) Pilot factor caused by other operational factors  - The instructor did not follow the standardization of the instruction, when he executed a decision in a hurry. - The crew did not respond to the sinking and pull up warnings (5) Pilot factor caused by error in the application of flight controls - The crew did not operate in accordance with the operational standard issued by the manufacturer and endorsed by the company. (6) Other (Air Traffic Control) - The air traffic controller contributed to the increase of the crew anxiety level when the controller used non standard phraseology."

The first for 19 minutes over Norfolk, the second for 29 minutes over New Jersey, and the third pattern over the CAMRN intersection for 29 minutes. Over CAMRN the aircraft descended from FL140 to FL110. At 20:44:43, while holding at CAMRN for 26 minutes, the New York (NY) ARTCC radar controller advised AVA052 to expect further clearance at 21:05. At that moment the Avianca crew advised ATC that they could only hold for 5 more minutes and that their alternate Boston couldn't be reached anymore due to the low state of fuel.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the flight crew to adequately manage the airplane's fuel load, and their failure to communicate an emergency fuel situation to air traffic control before fuel exhaustion occurred. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to use an airline operational control dispatch system to assist them during the international flight into a high-density airport in poor weather. Also contributing to the accident was inadequate traffic flow management by the FAA and the lack of standardized understandable terminology for pilots and controllers for minimum and emergency fuel states.

That contract, with Boeing Military Company of Wichita, provided for the delivery of Pratt & Whitney JT3D engines on Boeing airframes from commercial sources. Omega Air, Inc., and other operators and brokers had ferried a number of these airplanes to Davis Monthan Air Force Base. It was determined that other B-707 airplanes also had arrived at Davis Monthan AFB in a stripped condition. These airplanes had carried Special Airworthiness Permits issued by Designated Airworthiness Representatives (DARs.) The NTSB learned that third-party parts brokers had previously contracted to take avionics and instrumentation from these airplanes prior to the last leg of ferry flights. Approximately 50 indicators and annunciators had been removed from the pilots' instrument panels of the accident airplane prior to the attempted flight. As a result, the pilots' instrument panels contained only two airspeed indicators, an altimeter and a standby attitude indicator. Engine Exhaust Pressure Ratio (EPR) gauges were attached to the glare shield by masking tape. There was no standby magnetic compass (""wet compass"") or ""mechanical cockpit checklist"" on board. A checklist card, listing start, taxi and shutdown procedures was found at the accident site. The before-takeoff checklist was probably done from memory. The fact that the rudder trim was 7.9 to 8.3 units (79%-83%) nose right was not noticed prior to takeoff. In addition to the missed rudder, an item possibly overlooked in the before-takeoff sequence was the fastening of the captain's shoulder harness. Shortly after takeoff from runway 12 the airplane rolled right as a result of the rudder trim. The right hand wing tip struck the ground and the airplane cartwheeled.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Improper preflight planning/preparation by the pilot, and his failure to use a checklist.

All 121 passengers and six crew members were killed. Bhoja Airlines flight 213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 17:05 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route. The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 18:19 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead. At 18:26 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm. At 18:35, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180° to 270°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"". Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 18:39 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30°. However, only flaps 5 were selected.  The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm: ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken. The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope.  Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded: ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around. Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure.  The ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by cockpit crew caused the accident. The ineffective automated flight deck management was due to various factors including; incorrect selection of cockpit crew on account of their inadequate flying experience, training and competence level for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series), absence of formal simulator training in respect of FO for handling an automated flight deck, non-existence of cockpit crew professional competence / skill level monitoring system at operator level (Bhoja Air). The cockpit crew incorrect decision to continue the flight for destination and non-adherence to Boeing recommended QRH and FCOM remedial actions /procedures due to non-availability of customized aircraft documents (at Bhoja Air) for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series) contributed towards the causation of accident. The inability of CAA Pakistan to ensure automated flight deck variance type training and monitoring requirements primarily due to incorrect information provided by the Bhoja Air Management was also a contributory factor in causation of the accident."

	   Nigeria",En route,Cargo,Jeddah-King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED/OEJN),Kano-Aminu Kano International Airport (KAN/DNKN),"The aircraft was on a cargo flight from Jeddah (JED) to Kano (KAN). The total cargo uplift was 35 tonnes packed in 13 pallets and some loose bundles of merchandise that were loaded in the lower cargo hold. The departure from Jeddah was delayed for thirteen hours because of problems starting the no. 4 engine. The Boeing 707 departed at 13:48 UTC. As the aircraft approached N'Djamena at Flight Level 350, about 17:00 UTC, the flight engineer noted a strange smell in the cockpit. The ground engineer and the load-master who were sitting in the cargo compartment area of the aircraft confirmed that the smell had persisted for a while around them. It appeared that the area around pallet number 11 was misty. The pallet was sprayed with a fire extinguisher and the smoke evacuation procedure was carried out. This stopped the fumes temporarily. The aircraft was now halfway between N'Djamena and Kano with about 40 minutes flight time to go. At 18:00 the flight was cleared to descend. Then the Master Warning sounded, followed one minute later by a Fire Warning. Smoke entered the cabin. A descent was initiated with a descent rate close to 3000 feet per minute. Later the pitch trims became ineffective before the aircraft crashed into marshland. Tire ground marks at the scene of the accident indicated that the aircraft must have descended very slowly into the elephant grass and may have somersaulted on contact with the water, then exploded and disintegrated along the wreckage trail.  PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was a heat generating substance that was hidden in a cargo of fabrics inside pallet No. 11 in the cargo compartment of the aircraft. The heat that emanated from the pallet resulted in smoke that caused a major distraction in the cockpit and later caused an explosion which seriously impaired the flight controls of the aircraft."""

The aircraft came down in vegetation near a railway outside the airport, broke up and burst into flames. There were 107 passengers on board along with six Mexican crew members. Three passengers initially survived the accident. One survivor died on May 21 and a second died on May 25. The aircraft was owned and operated by Mexican airline Damojh Aerolíneas, operating as Global Air, on behalf of Cubana. XA-UHZ began its operations in Cuba starting May 14, 2018. On May 18, the day of the accident, the aircraft flew a trip from Havana to Santiago de Cuba and back, arriving at Havana at 10:20 hours local time. The next trip to be flight 972 to Holguín, Cuba, with a scheduled departure time of 11:00 hours. In the preparation for this flight calculations were made of takeoff weight and weight distribution. The cabin configuration on the load sheet differed from the actual configuration of XA-UHZ.  Based on these data the Centre of Gravity (CG) was calculated to be at 17.4%. Actually it was 28.5%, close to the rear limit of the aircraft, which is 29%. Consequently the horizontal stabilizer trim was set at 5 3/4 units, instead of 3 1/4 units. At 12:00 hours the flight was cleared to start the engines. Subsequently the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 06 for departure. In between working the checklists, the crew were engaged in non-flight related conversations.  After receiving clearance for takeoff, the aircraft began to accelerate down runway 06. As soon as it rotated from the runway, the aircraft attained a nose-high and right wing low attitude. The GPWS warning began to sound in the cockpit: ""Bank angle, bang angle!"" The bank angle reached 35° before the aircraft rolled back. It banked right and left several times with the nose reaching about 30 degrees nose up. The crew issued a Mayday call. The aircraft lost speed and began an uncontrolled descent until it impacted the ground about 40 seconds after lifting off the runway.  Most likely causes (translated from Spanish): The CEIAA has considered that the most probable cause of the accident was the collapse of the aircraft, as a consequence of its entry into abnormal positions immediately after the separation of the landing gear from the runway surface (Lift off) during take-off, which led to the loss of control due to a chain of errors, with a preponderance in the human factor. Contributing factors: - inconsistencies in crew training; - errors in weight and balance calculations; - low operational standards manifested in flight."

The crew decided to continue the flight to their home base at Baku, Azerbaijan. After a low pass along Baku's runway the aircraft turned to the left to return to the airport. Shortly afterwards engine power was lost as a result of fuel shortage. The plane struck light stanchions on a road bridge and crashed in a field.  Factors:  1) A malfunction of the landing gear retraction system, which led to flight with a landing gear extended and excessive fuel consumption. The subsequent failure to lock the left landing gear in the extended position made it necessary to do a second approach with a limited amount of fuel.  2) The fuel gauge indicator readings were inaccurate and prevented the crew from having correct info on the amount of fuel available and applying the flight manual's recommendations for low-fuel flights.  3) The lack of an airline bulletin on the features of the fuel system prevented the crew in the emergency situation from selecting the optimum mode for flying with a limited amount of fuel.  4) Inadequate operational and maintenance organization on the part of the companies Baku Air and ALG Inc."

The airplane operated on Sudan Airways flight SUD2241 and was carrying air conditioning units, auto parts, computers and personal effects. The flight took off from runway 30 at 15:29. During initial climb, the core cowls of engine no. 4 separated and fell on the runway.  The aircraft continued in a shallow climb with level wings when the pilot informed the ATC that he lost engine no.4. He assumed this because the no. 4 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) manifold flex line had ruptured, leading to erroneous reading on the EPR indicator. The crew interpreted the EPR reading as a failure of no. 4 engine; accordingly they declared engine loss and requested the tower to return to the airport. The aircraft went into a right turn, banked and continuously rolled to the right at a high rate, sunk, and impacted the ground with an approximately 90° right wing down attitude.  CAUSES: (a) the departure of the No. 4 engine core cowls; (b) the consequent disconnection of No. 4 engine EPR Pt7 flex line; (c) the probable inappropriate crew response to the perceived No. 4 engine power loss;  (d) the Aircraft entering into a stall after the published maximum bank angle was exceeded; and (e) the Aircraft Loss of Control (""LOC"") that was not recoverable.  Contributing Factors to the Accident were:  (a) the Aircraft was not properly maintained in accordance with the Structure Repair Manual where the cowls had gone through multiple skin repairs that were not up to aviation standards; (b) the Operator's maintenance system failure to correctly address the issues relating to the No. 4 engine cowls failure to latch issues; (c) the failure of the inspection and maintenance systems of the maintenance organization, which performed the last C-Check, to address, and appropriately report,  the damage of the No. 4 engine cowls latches prior to issuing a Certificate of Release to Service;  (d) the Operator's failure to provide a reporting system by which line maintenance personnel report maintenance deficiencies and receive timely and appropriate guidance and correction actions;  (e) the Operator's quality system failure to adequately inspect and then allow repairs that were of poor quality or were incorrectly performed to continue to remain on the Aircraft; and (f) the SCAA safety oversight system deficiency to adequately identify the Operator's chronic maintenance, operations and quality management deficiencies."
